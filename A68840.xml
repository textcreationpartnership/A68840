            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But when I conſidered that the office of this vertue Iuſtice (whiche ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth among mortall men like the bright ſtarre Lucifer) conſiſteth wholy in this, to render to euery man that which is his, I deſired verely to performe the ſame not maymed, nor diminiſhed, nor ſhortened, but conſiſting of all his partes, ſo much as humane weakenes would ſuffer me. And among other excellent parts or kindes therof, a thankfull minde, and mindfull of a benefite receaued, is not to be numbred among the leaſt, whoſe property is not onely to acknowledge be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefites receaued, but alſo earneſtlye to bee deſirous to geue thankes for them. This thing when I weigh with my ſelfe (for I thinke on it oftentimes, I wyll not ſay continually) there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into my remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce very many &amp; great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, which your publike welth, churche &amp; ſchoole haue heretofore beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. And aſſuredly, when I recken them, &amp; more depely weigh them, they appere vnto me ſo many &amp; ſo great, that I am excedingly afrayd, leaſt I ſhould happen to depart out of this life vngrateful, which thing vndoutedly ſhould be more bit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter vnto me, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death it ſelf. Ye, when I came out of Italy for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake, with moſt incredible humanity receaued me: ye gaue me the fredome of your moſt am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple city: ye placed me in that Schoole, which ye not long before with great praiſe of wyſe &amp; godly men had erected: ther ye appoynted me a Profeſſor of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wheras I liued a fellow with moſt learned and excellent men, more then fiue yeares. All which time ye mayntained me with a very liberal ſtipend. Ye, when I was called into England, decreed that I ſhould go thither, where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne yeares I was teaching the Goſpel in the Vniuerſity of Oxford, namelye vntil ſuch time as Edward the ſixt of that name, that moſt woorthye King, and which can neuer be prayſed inough, was taken away by vntimely death, which brought vnto all the godly, griefe, mourning, and ſundrye and hard vexacions. Ye exceding louingly receued me, when I returned thence to Argentine, &amp; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me in the ſame roume, wherin I was with you before. Alſo, when the moſt noble Senate of Tigure called me into the place of Pellicanus, which was ther
<pb facs="tcp:18396:4"/> a Profeſſor of Diuinity, ye, although both to your great griefe and alſo to mine, did yet moſt louinglye let me go. The cauſe of my departure I wyll not nowe ſpeake of, bicauſe it is to all men knowen wel inough. Thus much onely wil I ſay, that I do both vehemently deſyre, and alſo hope, that this ſtop or let may be taken away out of the field of the Lord. Theſe your benefits, which are of them ſelues ample and noble, I do nothing encreaſe nor amplify: But this one thing I teſtify, that they neuer ſlipped out of minde, neither is it poſſible but that they being layd vp in the bottom of my hart, ſhal there abide for euer. Howbeit, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the remembrance and thinking on the benefites which I haue receaued of you doth not ſatiſfy me, I haue alwayes deſired to make open vnto al men my good will and gratefull hart towardes you, which haue bene ſo wonderfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial towardes me, wherefore I haue very often times determined with my ſelfe, one tyme at the length to declare by ſome ſignification or monument my ſingular affection, and ardent loue towardes your publike wealth, Church and Schoole. But for as muche as touchynge ryches of thys worlde, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherwithal to performe the ſame, leaſt. I ſhould dye fruſtrate of my ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vehement a deſire, being about now to ſet forth a Comentary vpon the holy hiſtory of the Iudges: As I haue taught it in your Schoole, I haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to dedicate it to your name, where as otherwiſe I would haue offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you thinges much greater and better, if ſtrength &amp; ability had anſwered vnto my minde. Neither was I hereunto perſwaded onely by the reaſon now alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, namely by ſome maner of meanes to ſhew my good wyl towards you, and not to geue any man occaſion of ſuſpicion, that in chaunging my place I ſhould haue ſhaken of my endeuour and ſtudy towardes you: (which thing vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly is not ſo: For I haue not laid aſide theſe things, but they moſt firmly ſticke in my mind daily more &amp; more.) But this alſo did driue me to do this, for that this boke was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in your city. And therfore I thought it meete, that in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion therof no man ſhould be preferred before you. Farther, this did not a lytle moue me, for that the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this hiſtory moſt aptly agreeth with you. For euen as God at ſundry times ſtirred vp Iudges vnto the Hebrewes, to deliuer them when they were oppreſſed with the tiranny of their enemies: So wer you not amonge the laſt ſtirred vp by his goodnes and grace, to bring to lyght the Goſpell of the ſonne of God, when it was held captiue in darknes by the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and violence of hipocrites, and when the mindes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as touchyng godlynes were euery where in a maner baren and vnfruitfull. Here aſſuredlye I could make mencion of very many your actes both godly and honorable: but I ouerpaſſe them, for that you haue manye eloquent and notable publiſhers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade of your doinges, which moſt aboundantly and elegantly haue ſet foorth your valiantnes of minde, your conſtancy in embracing and ſpreading abroade of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and your liberality in maintaining your notable, moſte learned and famous Schoole. Neyther vndoubtedly can the praiſes which they haue geuen you bee reproued of anye lye, for as muche as you haue with great ſeruentnes of fayth receaued the doctrine of the ſonne of God, and ye are made vnto other a notable example of renuing of piety. And afterward when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of iniquity of times thinges which wer wel ordered, ſemed ſomwhat to ſlide and fall to decaye, ye hauing firme confidence of the ayde of God, verye godlys and wiſely tooke courage vnto you, and euen now in this time ye ſtoutly and luckely did driue out the remnantes of the Amorrihites and Chananites out of the inheritance of the Lord, which pertayned to your lot. Which your act hath wyth al the godly, gotten you great grace, prayſe, glory, and fauour. Wherefore I, as which vehemently deſyre honor, fame and dignity vnto the City of Argen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tine, do excedingly reioyce, for your moſt excellent and holy act. And I do deſyre god the father of mercy, that ye being inflamed and kindled with his ſpirit, may alwaies go forward to better thinges. For ſo long as we wander here on earth, as ſtraungers from our country which is in heauen, the Church is not fully per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect, neither in al partes abſolute: For alwayes ſomthing is therein wanting, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeing we are fallen into the yron age of the latter time. For was there not in the golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world of the Church many diſcords, troubles, and maners not agreable vnto a Chriſtian life? And ſhal not that part of the world which is chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtened, be now ſycke of the ſame diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities and vices, when for age it nowe doteth? Let vs looke vpon the Church of the Hebrues, which at that tyme was the peculiar people of God, ſeperated from al nacions. Vndoubtedlye we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:18396:4"/> there finde ſundry courſes and alteracions of thinges. Some times they ſlipped out of the rightway. Sometimes they repented and lamented and amended the ſynnes wherin they had fallen. But whileſt they lay in their ſinnes and wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, they were by God corrected with greuous afflictions, and moſt ſharp pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. But returning vnto him, they faithfully implored his ayde: which when they had obtayned, they agayne preuailed againſt their enemies. In them (except we be vtterly blinde) we ſee the image of the goodnes of God towardes the ſayntes, and his ſeuerity vpon the wicked painted, and liuely expreſſed as it were in a table that is moſt rightly poliſhed. Bleſſed is God, which defendeth his in moſt great daungers and calamities, and faythfully keepeth his ſafe and found: which commeth of his goodnes, neither ſuffereth he them wholye to fall from piety, or vtterly to be conſumed with miſeries and aduerſities. And we, if we note theſe thinges in thys holye hiſtorye, ſhall not maruayle that the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of God were often times toſſed, and euen in maner oppreſſed with ſo many and greuous chaunces: for whether we behold the godly, or whether we behold the vngodly, we ſhall perceaue that al theſe thinges were done with great fruit, and moſt wyſe conſideracion. For vnto thoſe, whom God the heauenlye father hath euen from without beginning choſen vnto him by Ieſus Chriſte, and our of an innumerable number of mortall men adopted to be his children, aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did to this end happen, that euen as gold and ſyluer are by the power of fire purged, ſo their mindes ſhould proue more pure by aduerſities. For by them as by lyuelye flames, the loue of our ſelfe, and of frayle and tranſitorye thinges is burnt vp. But the ſtudies of piety and innocency are wonderfully kindled and inflamed. But of the vngodly, whom the diuine prouidence hath moſt iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to puniſh with eternal death, the conſideracion is farre otherwiſe. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities do not burne away their ſpots and vices, but rather encreaſe and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, by the augmentacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which aduerſities the impiety of their minds alſo increaſeth, euen as we ſee that with one and the ſelfe ſame fyre claye waxeth hard, and wax melteth away.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the reading of the golden hiſtory of the Iudges is moſt profitable, ſo that there want not fayth in reading of them, and prayers be without ceaſing added, whereby we may pray vnto God not fayntly, but feruently, to make his woordes of efficacy in vs by the holy Ghoſt. For thoſe holye narracions are as it were certaine nouriſhments or ſtayes, whereby our confidence towardes the promiſes of God is wonderfully confirmed, and our minde is erected to a moſt firme hope of obtayning of them. For whyleſt we diligentlye conſider the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful notable actes which God did for the health and ſafety of the nacion of the Hebrues, it is vncredible to be ſpoken, how our hartes are ſtyrred vp to woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and honour him ſincerely and religiouſly. Farther, in thoſe heroicall actes the incredible power and wyſdome of the prouidence of God doth euery where aboundantly and brightly ſhine forth, which receaued with no leſſe pleaſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fruite. For by thoſe thinges which are declared (except we wyll wyllynglye be blinde) may eaſely be vnderſtand, that whatſoeuer was done, or ſucceded lucke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly or vnluckely, at home or on warfare, the ſame is to be attributed either to the iuſtice, or els to the mercy of the eternal God. We are alſo moſt plainlye taught, that God neglecteth not thinges humane. But that he hath a conſideracion and regard ouer the godly and the vngodly, and of them to the one he giueth ioy and pleaſure, but the other he at the laſt moſte greuouſlye puniſheth. Farther, thys thing is chiefly to be marked, that Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God is not ſecluded from thys holy hiſtory. For for as much as he is the end of the law, and ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the holy ſcripture, as much as this booke pertaineth vnto the law, and is a part of the holy ſcripture, ſo much doth it ſhew and moſt euidently preach Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Readers. For the actes of noble captaines are here rehearſed, which (as it is written vnto the Hebrues) through fayth wan kingdomes, wrought righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, and obtayned the promiſe. But that fayth which is natural and ſound includeth Chriſt him ſelfe, vnto whom ſingularly and in a maner onely it hath a regard. For by him the promiſes of God are made of efficacye. Wherfore whileſt we behold the wonderful actes of the Iudges, we ought to haue before our eyes the excellent fayth which brightly ſhined in them, &amp; together with it the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon deliuerer of humane kinde, namely the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, whom they beheld as their Captaine and Emperour. And that not vnwoorthely, for he by them wrought, and by them did ſet the people at liberty, in admoniſhing them
<pb facs="tcp:18396:5"/> by the voyces of Angels, and oracles of Prophetes, in confirming them in daun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers, and at the laſt not vnconſtantlye but moſt faythfullye performing thoſe thinges which he had before moſt liberally promiſed. Laſtlye, when we heare that the Hebrues, which were the members of the ſame Chriſt, were ſometime oppreſſed and ſlayne of their enemies. Let vs in them acknowledge the death and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of our head. And in their victories and triumphes. Let vs behold his reſurrection, kingdome and glory. For God hath framed vnto vs winges of his ſpirite and woord: but if through our own default we become fleſhy and hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy, we ſhal not be caryed vp into heauen, but together with beaſtes bee drawen downewarde.</p>
            <p>I haue hetherto ſpoken of the hiſtory, how commodious and profitable it is to all the worſhippers of god, and how aptly it pertayneth vnto you (moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent rulers.) Wherfore it ſhould ſeme that I ſhould now ſomwhat ſpeake of the interpretacion, which I haue added. But therof I wyll ſpeake nothing: for I feele that thoſe thinges which come out of my ſtudy and labour, are ſo ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſmall, that I thinke them not worthy of commendacion.</p>
            <p>There is one thing onely which I dare boldly affirme, that I by this my doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine, howſoeuer it be, my wyl was to be a helpe to the faythful of Chriſt. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I deny, but that there wer other much better learned then I am, which with great prayſe and fruit exerciſed themſelues in this ſelfe ſame courſe of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: howbeit, bicauſe I excedingly allow the ſentence of Baſilius (who in his .18. Epiſtle writeth: Euen as welles, the more they are drawen, the better they are, ſo vndoubtedly are the wordes of God: for the more diligently they are handled and vſed, the more plentiful fruit is by them receaued) therfore I tooke in hand to interpretate this hiſtory. And although I am not ignorant, that you do ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with the moſt learned woorkes of other men, that ye neede not thys my commentary: yet to that I anſwer, that to riche men alſo are debtes payde, and giftes are geuen vnto kinges, who otherwiſe are more riche. Who is more riche then God himſelfe? Vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuertheles al the godly do both geue thankes, &amp; alſo to their power referre thankes. Wherefore I doo not offer vnto you thys ſlight gift, bicauſe I thinke that ye haue neede thereof, but that your benefites ſhould not remayne with me longer then is meete, as though they wer neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Farther, that we might be ſtyl more and more bound together in amity. For theſe duties are certayn common bondes, wherwith men are pleaſauntlye and profitably bound together betwene themſelues. I haue in deede bene long in your debt, yea rather I ſhal alwayes be in your debt (for I ſhal neuer be able to pay al that I owe vnto you) wherfore I wil gladly be perpetually in your debt. And wil with great pleaſure alwayes behold, keepe and preſerue your benefits layd vp with me, ſo that they ſhal neuer dye, nor neuer at anye time ſlyp out of my mynde. So fare you wel (moſt worthy and noble men.) God the father of mercy encreaſe, proſper, and for euer bleſſe you together with your publike wealth, Church and Schoole, in al good thinges, through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour. Amen.</p>

Beſides that in the bokes which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to prophetes, lawes of liuing vprightlye are oftentimes written and clearely expounded. Neither can we properly ſeparate the bokes of Salomon &amp; other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynd (which they wil haue proper to wiſdome) from lawes and prophecies.

Furthermore for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are very many ſecretes opened vnto the church by the inſpiration of the ſpirite of god, they poure vndoubtedly into the attentife hearers, oracles of thinges to come. It may eaſily he graunted, that all theſe things which they make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, are founde in the holy bookes: I meane the precepts of liuing, notable hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, prophecies of thinges to come, and alſo moſte wiſe ſentences and ſayinges: but in ſuch ſort, that in maner in euery booke they are ſet forth vnto vs diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, neither yet would I that theſe holy bookes ſhould be deuided one from an other by theſe endes and limittes.</p>
            <p>I would rather thinke as the learned ſorte doe alſo iudge, that whatſoeuer thinges are conteyned in the holy Scriptures ſhould be referred vnto two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heades, the lawe I meane and the goſpell.<note place="margin">There be two principal poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes whereunto al the whole ſcriptures are referred.</note> For euery where are declared vnto vs either the precepts of god of vpright liuing, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are reproued to haue ſtrayed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of weakenes or els of malice, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel is layd forth before vs, wherin by Chriſt that thing wherein we haue offended is pardoned, and the ſtrength and power of the holy ghoſt promiſed vs, to reforme vs againe to the image of god, whiche we had loſte. Theſe two thinges maye we beholde in all the bookes of Moyſes, in the hiſtories, Prophetes, and bookes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to wiſdome, and that not onely in the olde Teſtamente, but alſo in the newe, and they are not ſeparated one from an other by bookes and leaues, but by that maner which is now declared.<note place="margin">What thinges are entreated of in thys boke of Iudges.</note> And this is ſufficient as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the generall matter of the holy ſcriptures. But nowe we muſt peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake of this booke, that we may vnderſtand what things they be which are entreated of in the ſame. And to the ende we may the more plainly vnderſtande this, it is nedefull to call to memory thoſe thinges which were ſpoken of in the former bookes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Geneſis</hi> is ſet forth the creation of the worlde, then howe of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob and his twelue childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was engendred the people of god and how
<pb facs="tcp:18396:8"/> they wer brought into Egipt to driue away their famine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exodus</hi> teacheth the greate encreaſe, and incredible multiplication of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, the maner alſo and forme wherby they were of god by Moyſes deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from bondage and ſet at liberty, and how they wer excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly adorned with lawes, iudgementes and ceremonies, whiche thinges are alſo comprehended in the bookes of <hi>Leuiticus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bookes which go before the iudges.</note> The booke of Numbers conteineth very many paſſages of the Hebrewes, and diuerſe placings and orderings of their tents in the deſert places, &amp; alſo certain vſages of thoſe rules which were preſcribed before of god in the lawes. And laſtly of al in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> When Moyſes ſhould depart out of this life, he like a moſt faithfull miniſter of god, &amp; moſte learned preacher, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peteth vnto the people almoſt the whole lawe.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was dead god gouerned the Hebrewes by certain excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were called Iudges, of which Iudges this booke which we haue taken in hand to enterpreate hath his name and title.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why thys is called the booke of the iudges.</note>But for the better vnderſtanding of the title therof we muſte know that this word <hi>Shaphat</hi> in the Iewes tongue ſignifieth ſomtime to execute the law, and to iudge the cauſes betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are at controuerſie, which office yet is not proper to thoſe Iudges, of whiche we nowe entreate. For there were Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites appointed which ſate and gaue iudgement at the gates of euery citye, and aboue all iudgementes ſate <hi>Senadrim</hi> which were an aſſembly of 70. elders.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Senadrim.</note>Furthermore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word ſignifieth to reuenge &amp; to ſet at libertie, which theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> performed, whoſe noble acts ar declared in this volume. They by their authoritie, through their might and counſell, deliuered the Iſraelites when they were oppreſſed of ſtraungers, and kept them in the obſeruing of the law &amp; true worſhipping of God. And that their office may the better be perceiued, we wyll briefly expound the face and eſtate of that publike weale. God himſelfe was the true and proper king of that nation,<note place="margin">Of the common wealth &amp; eſtate of the Iewes.</note> for he onely had the principal power there, but not as he had ouer other nations, but ſo, that he by his becke, oracle, and cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain commaundement, gouerned the eſtate of the Iſraelites, which he promiſed to do in the .18. chap. of Exodus. Wheras he ſaid that that people ſhould be hys chiefe kingdome. But bycauſe he would alſo vſe the miniſtery of men, he prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded al thyngs neceſſary for the Hebrewes, fyrſt by Moyſes and then by Ioſua as long as they liued. They exerciſed the office of princes or captaines, which men being dead god would haue the beſt and moſt excellent men to haue the rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for ſuch men were picked out to be of the ſenate, whoſe excellent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſet forth as well in <hi>Exodus</hi> as in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> for the lawes of God would not ſuffer euery one to be called to that office.<note place="margin">That is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt men are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours ouer the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale</note>) If thou ſhalt therfore con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider theſe men then ſhalt thou ſee the forme of that gouernment which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ariſtocratia.</hi> But bicauſe that it was not lawfull to attempt great matters without the peoples conſent, we may therfore iuſtly thinke that it was alſo a common wealth which endured to the tyme of <hi>Saule</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> the firſt kings. That eſtate therfore in reſpect of god was a kingdome, but in reſpect of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate &amp; thoſe chiefe men it was <hi>Ariſtocratia.</hi> Bicauſe in electing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had no regard to their riches but to their vertue and godlines, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the weightieſt matters wer referred to the people, therfore we may ſay it was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth. Wherfore it manifeſtly appeareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of matters of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits was very well te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered of three kinds of gouernments.<note place="margin">What was the cauſe of the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp of Iudges.</note> And bicauſe, wheras many gouerne the common wealth, it is nedefull when daungerous tymes doe happen, for the better ſucceſſe and expedition of thinges to be done, one muſte be

So god whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites wer moſt greuouſly oppreſſed of their enemies, iudged it mete to deliuer them and bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to libertie, he euermore ſtirred vp ſome one man by his ſpirit, whom he endued with noble vertues, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of body, warlike arte and other gifts mete for that purpoſe which ſhuld be brought to paſſe, by whoſe induſtry &amp; good ſucceſſe the people might be deliuered from tyrantes.</p>
            <p>Betwene forrayne nations and the Iſraelits in this ſimilitude,<note place="margin">The difference betwen the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges &amp; princes of the heathen.</note> thys diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is to be marked. Emperors and Dictators were appointed and choſen of men. But the iudges of the Hebrues wer not declared by the voyces of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">The iudges were neither properly lords nor kinges.</note> but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinance &amp; inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god. They could not be properly called capitaynes or kinges or els lordes, Poſteritie or ſucceſſion was here of no force, neither was there a regard to one perticular tribe or family, neither was there required the election of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aſſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people. In humane publique weales theſe vſe to take place, but God in thys hys publique weale preferred whom he pleaſed to be iudge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of things. Beſides that, they which are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voyce of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt firſt be endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> excellent ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; vertues, but god made thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he decreed to be Iudges &amp; ſetters at libertie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, notable and moſt excellent vppon the ſodayne, though they were neuer ſo much rude and vnmete of nature. And that this is true, witneſſeth the 2. chapter of this boke where it is thus written, God raiſed them vp Iudges, which deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them out of the handes of their oppreſſours. &amp;c. And therunto is added when the Lord had raiſed them vp a iudge, he was with the iudge, and deliuered Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell al the dayes of his lyfe. Moreouer theſe men in time of theyr authoritye were not in dede Lords ouer the Iſraelites, but onely wrought with authoritye, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, counſell and exerciſing warlyke trauayles. This is made playne by that that <hi>Gedeon</hi> as it is written in the .8. chap: when he had gotten the victorye ouer the Madianites, when it was offred hym to be king ouer Iſraell he refuſed it. For the people ſayd vnto hym: Reygne thou ouer vs and thy ſonne. By the which wordes they dyd not geue the kingdome onely vnto him, but alſo to hys poſteritye. But he would none of it, yea he anſwered them thus. I wil not reign ouer you, God ſhal reygne ouer you. And it is written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt boke of <hi>Samuel</hi> that God ſayd vnto the Prophet, They haue not caſt thee away but me,<note place="margin">The papiſts do impudentlye claime vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues the title of ſpirituall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> that I ſhould not reygne ouer them. It appeareth therefore manifeſtly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe Iudges were neyther kynges nor yet Lordes of the Iſraelites. I would to god that this kynde of authoritye were diligently marked in the popyſh Church, where wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men do ſo impudently vſurpe vnto themſelues ſpirituall promotion, ſeing that Chriſt hymſelfe as he is the true prieſt, ſo alſo is he oure only prieſt, for he only pacifyeth the father towardes vs and they whiche are gouernoures of the Church here on earth are to be counted only as hys miniſters. Wherfore they can not clayme vnto themſelues that title, but they muſte caſt away Chriſt and do hym iniurye.</p>
            <p>Neyther is thys to bee paſſed ouer, that the Iudges whiche were ordayned of god dyd alwayes deliuer Iſraell from the miſerye wherwith they were oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but the kinges, into whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common wealth did afterwards as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, did not alwaies deliuer the people out of bondage, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them,<note place="margin">The eſtate of the Hebrues was better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Iudges than vnder the kings.</note> yea they oftentimes deſtroyed them and compelled them at the length to ſlauery. Wherfore it is to be iudged y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the eſtate of the Hebrues was farre better vnder the iudges than vnder the Kynges: not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God gouerned not that people in tyme of the kyngs, but bycauſe hys adminiſtration ſhewed forth it ſelf more in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudges. And in dede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people was neuer led away into captiuity vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudges, although they were ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times oppreſſed by outward
<pb facs="tcp:18396:9"/> tyrantes which they deſerued by their wickednes.<note place="margin">Almoſt al the iudges were good and holy men.</note> That age therfore might be called as it were a golden age. Let vs marke alſo that there wer very few good and godly kings, but almoſt al the Iudges were good and godly. For although as they were men ſo ſometymes they fel, yet we muſt beleue that they returned againe into the right way and repented, for they are not condemned at any time by any teſtimony or Iudgement of the ſcripture as far as I can perceiue. How notably <hi>Syrach</hi> iudged of them he playnly declareth in hys booke of wiſdom the 46. chap. But we leauyng his teſtimony aſide, let vs ſee what the Epiſtle to the Hebrues in the xi. chap. doth aſcribe vnto them, where as it is thus ſayd. The tyme wil be to ſhort for me to tel of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> of <hi>Barach, Sampſon,</hi> and of <hi>Iephthe</hi> &amp;c. All theſe certeinly were iudges, and they are mencioned of there together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other holy men, which were notable and of an excellent and wonderful faith.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt aſke peraduenture, If god loked ſo wel to hys people as long as the iudges were ouer them,<note place="margin">Why the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elites were ſo oftentimes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of their enemies in the time of the iudges.</note> how came it to paſſe then, that they were ſo often brought into bondage by their enemies? For bicauſe God handled with them faithfully and by a couenaunt.</p>
            <p>The league that was made is written in the 30. and 31. chap. of Deut: where god promiſed the Hebrues that all things ſhould proſper with them ſo long as they kept his lawes and worſhipping of him. But if they ſhould fall from hym to Idols, and caſt away the lawes of their god, then ſhould they be deliuered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the handes of their enemies, but in ſuch ſort, that if they repented and would deſire ayde of their god, he would ſtreightwaies be preſent with them, to deliuer them from al the euils wherwith they ſhould be oppreſſed. But we ſhal not nede to ſtand long now about this matter, bicauſe it he proceding forward of the hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtory, we ſhal manifeſtly perceaue, that the Iſraelits did oftentimes offend. And god chaſtened them as his children with iuſt puniſhments. But when they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cried vnto him, he had compaſſion of them, and deliuered them by iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges out of their miſeries. This remayneth alſo for vs to declare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for as much as Chriſt is called the end and perfection of all the holy bokes, how theſe actes alſo of the iudges may and ought to be referred vnto him, and how they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie him vnto vs, as the other holy bookes do. To anſwer to this I will take that which Origen writeth in his firſt Homely vpon thys boke. Al the workes of god by themſelues are great:<note place="margin">After what ſort the holy hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine &amp; teach Chriſt</note> but when they are conferred together, ſome of them may be called ſmall, and other ſome greate. If god his leadyng of the children of Iſrael out of Egipte and throughe the wilderneſſe ſhould be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by themſelues, they are ſurely great woorkes: but if they be afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with this, that God loued the world ſo, that he gaue his onely begotten ſonne for it, then ſhall this be a great worke, and the others ſmall. But bicauſe in the greater things the leſſe are comprehended (for that they are partes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) as the number of two is contayned in thre, and thre in foure. So theſe pryuate deliueries of the people which happened vnder the Iudges, for as much as they are comprehended in that principall redemption, which is geuen vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynd by Chriſt, it muſt nedes be that they ſhuld expreſſe vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, for that they were certain aſſured partes and figuratiue ſhadowes, and had the ſame authour namely Chriſt him ſelfe. For he which before deliuered the Hebrues by iudges, did afterward redeme al men by him ſelf. And euen as the miſeries of thys lyfe, the ſpoyling I ſay of goods, baniſhments, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; torments are very greuous to the fleſh whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are pondred by themſelues: ſo when they are conferred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the anger of god &amp; euerlaſting death, into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we incurre by reaſon of our ſinnes, they may moſt rightly be eſtemed ſmall thinges, for that theſe are moſt greuous. Wherfore when we conſider how the Iewes were deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18396:9"/> miſeries: Let vs call to remembraunce, thoſe moſt great euils, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Chriſt of his ſingular goodnes hath deliuered vs. And when as the children of Iſraell do oftentimes eſcape by iudges out of their afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they do as it were point with their finger Chriſt vnto vs, raiſed vp from the dead, they ſhew vnto vs alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaints, wherin they ſhal be altogether deliuered from al afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; infirmities. Wherfore as wel this booke as alſo other holy hiſtories, do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much profit admoniſh the readers of Chriſt and his members.</p>
            <p>And bicauſe I think I haue ſpoken enough already of the matter and ſubiect of this boke. I wil now go to declare the forme of the writing therof.<note place="margin">
                  <p>What kind of writing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in this boke.</p>
                  <p>The definition of an hiſtory.</p>
               </note> It conſiſteth altogether of an hiſtorical kind of writing, as may eaſily appeare to al the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. An hiſtorye is (as <hi>Quintilianus</hi> writeth in the ſecond boke, &amp; 4. chap: of hys Inſtitutions) a ſetting forth of a thing done. From which Auguſtine differeth not much, who writeth on the ſecond chap: of Gen: vpon the letter.

But yerely chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles were, when things done in many yeres were compiled together, obſeruing the order of euery yeare. &amp;c. According to which ſentence, this our booke cannot be called a yerely chronicle, for that in the narrations thereof, it oftentimes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the yeres wherin things were done. Moreouer the ſame author I meane <hi>Gellius</hi> addeth <hi>Sempronius Aſellios</hi> mynde therin, but this was the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene thoſe whiche woulde leaue behinde them yearely chronicles, and thoſe which enterpriſed to write of thinges done by the Romaynes. The yerely chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles did declare that onely whiche was done and in what yeare it was done, but that was not ſufficient for an hiſtory to declare what was done, but it muſt alſo ſhew, by what counſell, and after what ſort they were done. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame <hi>Aſelio</hi> writeth in the ſame booke: for neither can the bookes of the yerely chronicles any thing ſtirre vp the readers to be more quicke to defend the common wealth, nor yet more ſlow to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit thinges vnaduiſedly. Furthermore bicauſe that by the knowledge of this booke men are admoniſhed and ſtirred vp to the true worſhippyng of god to repent, to put their truſt in god, and to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe all dueties of lyfe cherefully. It conteyneth an hiſtory and not yerely Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles. Peraduenture I haue expounded theſe thinges with to many woordes, but yet as I ſuppoſe with ſome fruicte.</p>

We vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande by the diuyne hiſtorye that Abraham was a holye man and dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of god, and alſo one that kepte very good hoſpitalitie. Whereby we learne that hoſpitalitie is a noble vertue, and very deare vnto God, and againe we are taughte to auoyde thoſe thinges, which we ſee theſe godlye men to haue auoyded. For when we conſider howe <hi>Dauid</hi> woulde not kil <hi>Saul</hi> hys deadly enemye, hauing twice libertie to doe it, we gather that it is not to bee permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that priuate men althoughe it laye in their power ſhoulde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> reuenge their priuate iniuries. The other vſe of examples is that of theſe thinges whiche are there declared perticularly, when we ſhall perceaue that they be al like, we may of them gather generally and vniuerſally ſome one profitable ſentence.</p>
            <p>By the hiſtory of the Sodomites we note how greuouſly, god puniſhed moſt horrible fleſhly filthines, and that the tribe of Beniamin for the ſame cauſe was almoſt cleane put out, and Ruben the firſt begotten ſon of Iacob for inceſt was put beſides his place and dignity, <hi>Dauid</hi> for committing aduoutry, incurred hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible puniſhmentes, and <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Abſolon</hi> for committing inceſt came to a moſt wycked end, and <hi>Troy</hi> (as the heathen teſtifye) was vtterly ouerthrowen for aduoutry ſake. Of theſe things therfore in ſuch ſort conſidered which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perticularly, we plainly ſay that all theſe wandring and vnlawfull luſtes of men are moſt greuouſly puniſhed of god.

            <p>Yet in this kind of arguments that vice is moſt diligently to be taken hede of,<note place="margin">Of examples we reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what vices are to be eſchewed.</note> which creapeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one before he beware thereof.

For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as men, they fell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, &amp; that moſt filthily. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we do ſet forth as examples to be folowed of vs, muſt with great iudgement be examined.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> writeth of this thing in his 2. booke againſt the 2. epi. of <hi>Gaude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius</hi> after this ſort.

For who woulde followe Dauyd his horrible aduoutrye and betraying of fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Souldiours, or the forſwearyng of <hi>Peter</hi> or hys wycked diſſimulation? ſurely none which hathe but euen a cromme of godlineſſe. Moreouer it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes happeneth that that worke whiche is done well and rightly by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:18396:11"/> perſon, is forbidden of other men, bycauſe God whiche hath geuen a lawe to men, is not ſo bounde vnto the ſame, that he may not loſe ſome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that common bonde, when it ſemeth good vnto him. It is not lawfull for any man to ſteale,<note place="margin">God will ſome times haue cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine thinges done of godly men whiche be not lawfull for others to do.</note> and yet the Hebrewes when they were led out of Egypt were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yea and commaunded of god, to cary awaye the Egyptians goodes whiche they had borowed of them euen agaynſt their willes and without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. What ſhal we do then? Thus truly, we muſt well and diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre thoſe thinges which are expounded in the holy hiſtories, with the general rules of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of God wherewith when we do perceaue that they do agree,<note place="margin">The doynges of ſaintes muſt be weighed by the rules of gods Law.</note> let vs boldly vſe them. But if they diſagree from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs recken them either for certaine fallinges or ſingular prerogatiues of ſome, and kepe our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues backe from following of them. And theſe prouiſoes beyng added, great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſhall come by reading of hiſtories and eſpecially diuine hiſtories. And that did <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> very well vnderſtand when as in the preface of his expoſition vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> he wiſhed that all thoſe thinges had bene written for vs, which the Apoſtles ſpoke and did, when they ſat downe, what they did eate, or what they did write &amp; other thinges of this kynde. And the ſame <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> writeth in his 57. Homily vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that hiſtories were geuen vs by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt to the entente we ſhoulde followe them.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Alſo <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his ſeconde booke and 28. chap. <hi>De doctrina Chriſtiana,</hi> teacheth that many darcke and hard thinges may ſome times onely be opened by the knowledge of an hiſtory. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer who ſoeuer muche exerciſeth him ſelfe in redyng ouer of hiſtories, he doth not without fruite reuolue with him ſelfe the doinges &amp; examples of our times. There was vpon a tyme a certaine man euill fauored enoughe,<note place="margin">Note a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunte hiſtorie.</note> who neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was meruelous deſirous of beautifull children: and yet he maryed a fowle wyfe, wherfore he was mocked of euery bodye. This man went into the Citie. where he bought moſt fayre ymages, whiche he ſet in his chambre, and gaue his wife charge that for a certayne ſpace ſhe ſhould euery day moſt earneſtly looke vpon thoſe ymages. She obeyed her huſbandes commaundement, and by that meanes brought him forth moſt beautifull children. So wil it alſo come to paſſe with vs, which thoughe we by reaſon of naturall ſinne grafted in vs are defour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; lothſome, and are continually prouoked as well by the deuill as by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to vnlawfull thinges, yet if we will attentiuely &amp; diligently gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the ſainctes, trimly paynted forth in the diuine hiſtories, and if we reuolue the ſame in our mynde, we ſhall forthwith ſhewe forth moſt excellent workes &amp; acceptable to God. And now that I haue entreated enough (as I ſuppoſe) of the matter and forme of writing of this booke, the nexte is to ſpeake ſome what of the efficient cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What is the efficient cauſe of this booke.</note>If we would ſearche to knowe the man, by whom God would haue theſe thinges written, that can we not vnderſtand by the holy Scriptures.

Other alſo thincke that euerye Iudge wrote ſuche thinges as were done in his own time, which monument of theirs being in ſondry pampheletes <hi>Samuel</hi> afterwarde compiled into one certain bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or volume. Agayne there be ſome whiche aſcribe all this to <hi>Eſdras</hi> or to <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> the king, which <hi>Ezechias</hi> the booke of Prouerbes mencioneth to haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together ſome of the ſentences (or as ſome call them) the parable of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> but I thincke it is not mete for me to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de about this matter, for there is no cauſe why we ſhould curiouſly ſearche out thoſe things which God will not reueale in his oracles wherfore I will returne to declare the principall efficient cauſe of this booke.<note place="margin">The ſpirite of God is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the aucthour of this Booke.</note> We muſt aſcribe al what ſoeuer it is to the ſpirite of God.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18396:11"/> and there is no doubte but he ſpake then of the bookes of the olde Teſtament.

For nether can the holy lyfe of the teachers nor yet miracles be ſufficient to perſuade vs of this. It is the ſpirite, the ſpirit I ſay of god which teſtifieth vnto our ſpirite of this thyng.</p>
            <p>The moſte daungerous error of the Antichriſtes muſt diligently be taken hede of, whiche dare affirme,<note place="margin">It is not the Church which geueth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Scriptures.</note> that it is the Churche which bringeth authoritie to the holy Scriptures, when as it is cleane contrary.

                  <p>There be three offices of the Churche tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word of God.</p>
                  <p>The Churche as a witneſſe kepeth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bookes.</p>
               </note> I do attribute thre offices and them moſte excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as touchyng the worde of GOD. The firſte of them is, that I do confeſſe that the Church as a witneſſe hath kept the holy bokes. But thereby it can not be proued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is lawful for it to peruert or alter any thing in the holy bookes. Experience teacheth vs that publique and priuate wrytinges are committed to ſcriueners (whiche are commonly called notaryes) to be layd vp and diligently kept of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet there is none that is in his right wittes which wil ſay that he may alter any thing in them, or wil beleue that their authoritie is of greater force, than their willes were whiche deſired to haue the ſame written.<note place="margin">The worde of God reuealed and written.</note> Neither ſhall it be here vnprofitable to obſerue the difference betwene the worde of god as it was reuealed at the beginning to the Prophetes &amp; ſainctes &amp; as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes preached or written. For we do eaſely acknowledge betwene theſe, that there is onely difference of tyme, and not of the authoritie or efficacie.</p>
            <p>For we confeſſe that the worde vnwritten was more auncient, than that which was afterward appointed to letters, and we graunt that either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred together was geuen to the Churche, but in ſuche ſorte, that the Churche (as we haue ſayd) can not by any meanes wreſt or chaunge it.<note place="margin">The office of the Churche is to publiſhe and preache the worde of God.</note> And this vndoubtedly is the ſecond office of the Church, to preach &amp; publiſh the wordes committed vnto it by God. In which thing it is lyke a common crier, who althoughe he do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe the decrees of princes and magiſtrates, yet he is not aboue the decrees or equal vnto them in authoritie. But his whole office is faithfully to pronounce all thynges as he hath receaued them of the princes and magiſtrates. And if he ſhould otherwiſe do, he ſhould be counted altogether for a traytour. Wherfore the miniſters of the Churche ought to care and ſtudy for nothing ſo much as to be founde faithfull. We acknowledge alſo the laſt office of the Churche to be,<note place="margin">The Churche diſcerneth the holy bokes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> counterfaite &amp; ſuch as are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochriphas.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeyng it is endued with the ſpirite of God, it muſt therfore diſcerne the ſincere &amp; vncorrupted bookes of holy Scriptures from the counterfaite and <hi>Apocriphas,</hi> whiche is not yet to be in authoritie aboue the worde as many do fooliſhely dreame. For there are very many which can diſcerne the true &amp; propre writings of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> from other falſely put to them, &amp; yet in compariſon of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
<pb facs="tcp:18396:12"/> they are neither of greater lernyng nor yet of equall, with <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi> And euery one of vs ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eaſely know God from the deuill, &amp; yet are we not to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted equal with God, &amp; much leſſe can we thinck that we do excel him. So the Churche ought not bycauſe of this to preferre faith or authoritie thereof before the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note>But they ſay, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth, I would not beleue the Goſpell except the authoritie of the Churche did moue me therunto. But in that place is read (to moue together) for in very dede,<note place="margin">Faith is not poured in by the miniſter but by God.</note> it is the ſpirite of God, which poureth faith into the hearers of his worde. And bycauſe the miniſters of the Churche are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, they are rather to be ſayd to moue with, than abſolutely to moue. The ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth in his 28. booke and ſecond chap. againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that the Maniches ought ſo to beleue that the firſt chap. of <hi>Matthew</hi> was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>Matthew,</hi> euen as they did beleue that the Epiſtle whiche they called <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> was written by <hi>Maniche,</hi> bycauſe vndoubtedly they were ſo kept by their elders, &amp; from hande to hand deliuered vnto them. This is it therfore that the Churche moueth withall to beleue the Goſpell, bycauſe faithfully it kepeth the holy ſcriptures, preacheth them, and diſcerneth them from ſtraunge Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The ſame father manifeſtly witneſſeth in his 6. booke of his confeſſions the 4. and 5. chap. that God him ſelfe in very dede did geue authoritie to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Tertullianus Irenaeus</note> But <hi>Tertullianus</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hauing to do againſt heretikes did therfore ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Apoſtolicall Churches, bycauſe they did not admitte the whole ſcriptures: Wherfore they would that they ſhould take their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe Churches which were certainly knowen to be Apoſtolical. For it was meete that thoſe Churches ſhould continuallye remayne both witneſſes and alſo keapers of the holy ſcriptures: and yet therfore they did not decree that the authoritie of the Churche ſhould be preferred before the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What is to be thought of a certayn rule of the Logiciens.</note>But the aduerſaries ſay, that they are led by the ſentence, whiche is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed among Logiciens: <hi>Euery thyng is ſuch a thyng by reaſon of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, VVherfore that other ſhal more be counted ſuche.</hi> Wherfore they reaſon after this maner: If by the Churche the Scripture hath hys authoritie, it muſt nedes be that the Church much more hath that authoritie. But they reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that this ſentence put by the Logiciens taketh place onely in finall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and is of no ſtrength in efficient cauſes. For althoughe our inferior worlde be made warme by the ſunne and the ſtarres, yet doth it not thereby followe that they are farre more warmer. And agayne when immoderate men by wyne are made droncke, we can not therby conclude the wyne to be more dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken than they. Yea the Logiciens teache this, that this their ſentence is then ſtrong and of efficacy in efficient cauſes, when ſuch efficient cauſes are brought forth whiche are whole and perfect, and not whiche are perciall and maymed, whiche rule is not obſerued of our aduerſaries in this argument. For the Churche is not the whole and perfect efficient cauſe of that faith and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whiche the holy Scriptures haue with the faithfull. For if it were ſo, then were it very eaſy to perſuade the Ethnickes and Turkes of the holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and to bryng the Iewes to receaue the new Teſtament, and how true this is, the thing it ſelfe witneſſeth. And I thincke. I haue ſpoken enough of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of this booke and of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of the ende of this booke.</note>And now laſtly order ſemeth to require, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeyng we haue ſpoken of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, forme and efficient cauſe of the holy bookes, we ſhoulde alſo entreate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to what end they were written. Wherin I thincke it not nedeful to kepe the reader long, for that before when I entreated many thynges of an hiſtorye, I haue expounded alſo the profite and commodities whiche come therof, whiche no doubte of it, belong vnto the ende: but nowe preſently I will ſay thus much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18396:12"/> compendiouſly, that all theſe thinges are mentioned by the holy ghoſt, that we ſhoulde behaue our ſelues vprigthly both in proſperitie and alſo aduerſitie.</p>
            <p>For we learne by the examples of holy men, when we are afflicted with ſundry troubles and miſeries, ſtedfaſtly to holde our faith, to put our hope in God, to call vpon him only, &amp; therewithall to repent vs of our ſinnes whiche thinges if we do, he will no leſſe be preſente to helpe vs, than we know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he oftentimes deliuered the people of the Iewes. And this <hi>Paul</hi> declared, when he ſayde to the Romaines, whatſoeuer things are written, they are written for our learning, that we thorough patience and conſolation of the Scriptures might haue hope. Moreouer we are inſtructed, in proſperous thinges to kepe the feare of god, leſt we fal into grieuous ſinnes, by whiche meanes we might be made guiltie both of puniſhement in this lyfe, and alſo of euerlaſtyng damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally we may moſte manifeſtly gather the ende of reading of theſe bookes out of the Apoſtles doctrine, whiche he deliuered to <hi>Timothe,</hi> writing after this ſorte in his ſecond Epiſtle and third chap. All Scripture geuen by inſpiration of God is profitable to doctrine, to reprouing, to correction and to inſtruction which is in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the man of God may be perfect and prepared to al good workes.</p>
            <p>And now that as I ſuppoſe I haue ſpoken enough of the end and other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this booke, I will come nygher to the expoſition of the ſame, &amp; firſt I wil declare whether this booke according to the ſentence of the Hebrewes be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of the firſte Prophetes, whoſe coniunction is ſo great with the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ioſua</hi> that a man woulde eaſely ſaye that they be both one.<note place="margin">Whether the booke of Ioſua ought to be reckened with the booke of Iudges.</note> And peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there be ſome which ſuppoſe that <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſhould be reckened with the iudges: to whom I will not ſubſcribe. For iudges were raiſed vp of god, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were oppreſſed with outwarde enemies, but when <hi>Ioſua</hi> was proclaymed prince, all the affaires of the Iſraelites were in good proſperitie. For <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> moſt mightie kinges were ouercome, and that office was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to <hi>Ioſua,</hi> wherby <hi>Moyſes</hi> being dead he might leade the people ouer <hi>Iordane</hi> and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> and deuide the promiſed lande by lottes vnto the children of Iſraell, and beſides that the people did ſet their handes to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree whiche they had made of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> that he whiche obeyed not his voyce ſhould be killed, as we read it written in the firſt chap. of his booke. But there is no mention made of ſuche thynges as concernyng the Iudges. And yet both the bookes are ſo like and of ſuch affinitie, that many thinges are repeated in this our booke eſpecially in the beginning, whiche no doubte were done when <hi>Ioſua</hi> was yet lyuing.</p>
            <p>There reſteth now to admoniſhe the reader ſomewhat of the partes of this boke.<note place="margin">The partes of the booke of Iudges.</note> There are as many principall membres in it as there were Iudges to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> tyme. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in euery one of them ſtill riſeth vnto vs a new hiſtorye. But the firſt of all was <hi>Othoniel,</hi> of whom we will ſpeake in the third chap. So that all thoſe thinges whiche are written vnto that place do contayne the thynges done from the death of <hi>Ioſua</hi> vnto <hi>Othoniel.</hi> And certainly bycauſe the Iewes, as long as <hi>Ioſua</hi> liued, worſhipped god a right, &amp; kept the lawe as muche as the weakeneſſe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coulde do: god ſtil wrought with them accordyng to his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, &amp; gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great victorye ouer their enemies, ſo that euery tribe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his enemies for the moſt part which were yet adioynying to their borders. And then when the Iſraelites obteynyng the victorye did tranſgreſſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of their god, &amp; did not cleane deſtroy the nations which they had ouercome as god had commaunded them, yea they made them tributaries vnto them, god therfore grieuouſly admoniſhed them by his meſſanger, bycauſe they had not onely ſaued their enemies, but alſo had moſte filthyly honoured theyr gods. So that god was not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a cauſe angry with them, and deliuered them
<pb facs="tcp:18396:13"/> into the handes of outwarde tyrannes. But when they were ſorye for it and called vpon their god, he had compaſſion of them, and rayſed them vp Iudges, by whom they might be deliuered, &amp; when they were deliuered, they fell agayne to Idolatry &amp; they were afflicted againe, &amp; they repented, wherby in courſe their deliueries and oppreſſions are ſet forth. But their firſt oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was vnder <hi>Chuſan Reſanthaim,</hi> from the which <hi>Othoniel</hi> the firſt of al the iudges reuenged them, of whom we will ſpeake in his place.

An other way was, when ſom holy men by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouing of god did appoint to themſelues certayn tokens of thinges to come, which did ſignify before, whether they happened this waye or that, what ſhould be looked for.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Abraham</hi> hys ſeruaunt decreed with hymſelf that ſhe ſhould be his Lordes wife, which only amongeſt many maydens comming to the well, offred drinke

Selomo</hi> expounding aſcribeth the ſame place to Lottes, and ſayth that the names of euery tribe were fyrſt writen in ſcrolles, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into a certayne potte, out of the which they were afterwarde drawen by the hand of the Prophet. This is his iudgement. Although. <hi>R. <hi>D.</hi> Kimhi</hi> thinketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that iudgement was geuen by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim.</hi> But howſoeuer it was it ſkilleth not much, for no man ought to doubte but that there were lots vſed at that tyme. For <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, that lots were caſte into a pet and gouerned by god. Yea and the promyſed lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> was no otherwiſe deuided vnto the people tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by lots. But by what meanes, in what places, or after what ſort they were had, it is no place here to declare. It were to long to tell what <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim</hi> properly were. <hi>R. <hi>D.</hi> Kimhi</hi> ſpeaketh aboundauntly of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the booke, which we now haue in handes, when he expoundeth the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the concubine reuenged agaynſt the <hi>Gabaonites,</hi> And I will ſet forth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time in a more fytte place what it ſhould ſeme to be.<note place="margin">The manner to aſke counſell of Gods hand was before the lawe geuen.</note> Neyther dyd thys cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome for aſking councell of God floryſh only in the tyme of <hi>Moyſes</hi> law, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the patriarches tyme.

                  <p>There are three cauſes alledged,<note place="margin">Why God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed not by and by all the Chananites.</note> why God would not by and by deſtroye all the Iſraelites enemies out of the lande of <hi>Chanaan.</hi> The fyrſte is, bycauſe the Iewes at the beginning wer not ſo many in numbre, as coulde inhabite all the land, So that by that meanes if all the <hi>Chananites</hi> ſhould haue bene deſtroyed, moſt part of the land ſhould haue lyen waſte. Whereby many and ſundry wilde beaſtes (wherewith the regions in the Eaſt abound) would maruelouſlye haue encreaſed, deſtroyed the poſſeſſions, and brought no ſmall damage and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Hebrewes. This reaſon is alledged of God hym ſelfe in <hi>Exodus.</hi> An other cauſe was that the Hebrewes myght throughly learne to fyght, and to be expert in warres agaynſt their enemyes, and they coulde not doo that neyther in Egipt, nor yet in the wyldernes. The thyrd cauſe was, that they might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feare God more and more, for they vnderſtandyng that they obtayned vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and poſſeſſion of the lande as long as they obſerued their religion, and contrarywyſe, how they were oppreſſed with moſt greuous miſfortunes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and miſeries, when they forſooke the obedience and woorſhipping of God, they myght at the leaſt by thys meanes be ſtyrred vp not to faynt from theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lawes and moſt holy ordinaunces of God. I would to God the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eſpecially the two latter whych are deſcribed in the thyrde chapter of thys booke myght teache vs, why God wyl haue them whych are hys to be ſubiect in thys lyfe to ſo greuous and ſo many temptacions, namely that by fyghtyng and wraſtlyng we myght be exerciſed wyth fruite and profytte, callyng vpon God continually.</p>
                  <p>But why God choſe the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The prayſe of the tribe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</note> to begynne the battayle firſt againſt the enemyes, many reaſons may be alledged. Fyrſt, that tribe was very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, of great force, valiaunt of courage, warlyke, and verye experte therein. Whych neuertheles I ſpeake not, as thoughe the election of God were moued by theſe gyftes: yea rather in that poynt the cleane contrarye is to be affirmed, namely that thys trybe was therefore valiaunt and warlyke, bycauſe God him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe had deſtinied it to exerciſe thoſe offices. Neyther is it to be doubted,<note place="margin">The election of god tarieth not for our gyftes and vertues.</note> but that both valiauntnes and warlyke ſtrength are hys giftes. But that reaſon whych I haue declared is thus to be vnderſtand, that theſe excellent gyftes which wer freely geuen of God to the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> made it apt to begynne the battayle fyrſt againſt the enemies. Neyther had it this kind of office co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this preſent, but alſo afterward when they ſhould make war againſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iamites,</hi> God being aſked counſel of, decreed that marchyng forwarde to battail ſhould be by the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to geue to it that it might be as it were a chiefe captayne to all the other Iſraelites. In the booke of <hi>Numbers</hi> for pytching the Campes, it had the chiefe place. Alſo the kinglye power was attributed vnto it by the oracle of <hi>Iacob.</hi> And as the Hebrewes write, it was the fyrſt of al the reſt that paſſed ouer the red ſea. But for thys it is woorthy to beare awaye the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, bycauſe of that tribe <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be geuen not onely to the Iewes, but alſo to al the world. Neither happened theſe priuileges and dignities to <hi>Iudah</hi> by order of birth. For it was reckoned the fourth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob. Ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ben</hi> in deede was fyrſt borne, but bycauſe of his vile inceſt, wherby he abſtayned not euen from his fathers bed, he was throwne downe from hys proper digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in his ſteade as concerning the kyngdome <hi>Iudah</hi> was ſubſtituted. But the dignity of birthright was geuen to <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wherein Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah excelled the tribe of Ephra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>im.</note> Wherefore his firſt tribe called <hi>Ephraim</hi> was not onely valiant &amp; mighty, but alſo was exalted to the kyngdom of ten trybes: which kingdome neuertheleſſe was both vnconſtant, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not alwayes in that famyly. But the principallity of <hi>Iudah</hi> is euerlaſting, bycauſe it was not taken away from it euen to Chriſtes tyme, and he comming of that family, raygneth and ſhall raygne for euer. All whych thynges <hi>Iacob</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18396:15"/> hym ſelfe confirmed wyth hys noble prophecye, wherein he fore ſayde to hys children what thynges ſhoulde happen to them in the latter tymes.

For the ſpirite of god doth euer wel agree with it ſelfe, as it whiche bringeth thoſe things to paſſe, which are agreable to his prophecyes.</p>
                  <p>

Therefore there is ſmal profyte by the labour taken in them. Neuertheleſſe I except thoſe which are put in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Whither firme argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts may be brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Allegories.</note> for they are to be counted the wordes of the holy ghoſt.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions and argumentes are very weake. For men being the authors of them myght both be deceaued, and alſo deceaue.

For whatſoeuer they were that defended the people of God in the olde time, Chriſt was theyr hed and captayne. Wherfore whatſoeuer they dyd in defendyng of hys members, they did it as his miniſters and vicars. Wherby he which religiouſly reuolueth their actes in his minde, and then putting them aſyde, doth behold the hed and chiefe captayne,<note place="margin">Howe thoſe thinges agree with Chriſt which ſeme to be ſpoken of Dauid &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</note> by whoſe conducting they obtayned the victoryes.

Moreouer, he wold not haue the poſſeſſion of thoſe regions aſcribed vnto their own ſtrength or power, but vnto him ſelfe. Ye ſhall not take it (ſaith he) but I haue deliuered the land into their handes. And he vſeth a verbe of the preterperfect tenſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by the certainty of hys ſayinges ſhoulde be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Of this place we may iuſtlye gather,<note place="margin">We muſt aſke counſel of God when wee take any thinges or affaires in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> that in buſines which we take in hande what ſo euer they be, God muſt alwaies be aſked counſel of.

                  <p>And it wer good to marke the difference which is found betwene the aſking counſel of God in the old time and ours at this preſent.<note place="margin">Howe wee and the elders do di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſly aſke cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſel of God.</note> They were very much carefull for the ſucceſſe of thinges, and they almoſt deſyred alwayes to knowe when they tooke warres in hand, or attempted anye other thyng, whether they ſhould ſpeede wel or il in them. And that was not hard for them to do, for they had an oracle prepared of God for them for that purpoſe. And God had promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he would anſwer them out of the mercy ſeate, what ſoeuer they ſhould demaunde or aſke of him. But we, if we ſhould aſke counſel of the holye ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the ſucceſſe and end of our enterpriſes and purpoſes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infelicities and miſfortunes, we ſhould ſeeme, and that not vnwoorthily, to play the fooles. For there is no place there at all, which anſwereth anye thyng for our ſingular and priuate thinges.

                  <p>But why the Iewes had proper and certayne oracles geuen them for theyr matters, and we haue nothing anſwered vs particularly.<note place="margin">Why we haue not oracles as the Iewes had</note> I thynke there be no other cauſe, but bycauſe vnto that people a certain aſſured publique wealth was due by the immutable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of God, which ſhould endure to the time of Chriſt, and therefore there were prepared for it certaine extraordinarye aydes aboue the power of nature, whereby it ſhould be kept and defended by God. But vnto vs there is no ſuch promiſe made of any certain ſeate or publique wealth, ſeing that our church is diſperſed throughout the whole world, whereunto is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſeate or place promiſed, and therefore it needed not, that concernyng hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine thinges our publique wealthes ſhould be particularly gouerned by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine oracles &amp; anſwers for temporal thinges. Beſides this, the volumes of the holy ſcriptures are more aboundaunt in our tyme, than they were at that time with the Hebrewes when theſe thinges were done whych we nowe expounde.

And ſeing that thoſe writinges are ſo manye &amp; ſo excellent, it is no maruayle if we are not euery day enſtructed of god by new oracles &amp; anſwers.

But ſurelye this <hi>Simeon</hi> was of the ſame region that <hi>Iudah</hi> was, and both their endeauours tended to thys ende, religiouſly to fulfyl the wyll of God.

But they whych affirme thoſe thynges, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider wyth them ſelues two thynges. Fyrſt, that the kyngdome of the tenne Tribes had now fallen from God, and from woorſhypping of hym. Wherfore if an vngodlye kyng was ſtyrred vp agaynſt it, the ſame is not for all that to be conferred wyth thoſe, whych confeſſing them ſelues to be Chriſtians, do incenſe Tyrannes whych are of a ſtraunge religion agaynſt other Chriſtians. Beſydes that, thys deede of <hi>Aſa</hi> kyng of <hi>Iudah</hi> is mencioned in the holy ſcriptures. But we cannot fynde that it was allowed to be well done. Yea if we looke vpon the latter booke of Chronicles the ſyxtene chapter, we ſhall ſee that that kyng was moſt greuouſly rebuked of God by the Prophet for ſuche a wycked deede. For it is thus wrytten: <hi>At that tyme came Hanani the Sear to Aſa kyng of Iudah, and ſayde vnto hym: bycauſe thou haſte truſted in the kyng of Siria, and not rather put thy truſt in the Lorde thy God, therefore is the hoſte of the kyng of Siria eſcaped out of thyne hande.

                     <hi>And the Lord deliuered the Chananites.</hi> The holy Scripture obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his olde order, to ſay that they whiche are ouercome in battaile are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into their enemies handes by God, and ſpeaketh thus to adminiſhe vs, that victory is not the worke of our owne ſtrength, but of the goodneſſe and counſel of God. Wherfore ſouldiours and emperours whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue the vpper hand in battailes, they muſt bridle them ſelues from boaſting and gloryeng, which <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> alſo faithfully geueth counſell to do. For he ſayth, let not him that is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye glory in his owne ſtrength. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> kyng of the <hi>Babilonians</hi> foliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſing this, was ſo vexed &amp; toſſed with madneſſe, that he was almoſt chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a dumbe beaſte. Wherefore the adminiſtration of the kyngdome was taken away from him, &amp; he liued in great miſery of long time, who out of doubt had not fallen into ſo great miſfortune, if (as it was mete) he had confeſſed that what ſoeuer he had gotten was geuen him by the prouidence and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of God. But as <hi>Daniel</hi> mencioneth, he being puffed vp with the nobleneſſe and dignitie of his actes, moſt preſumptuouſly and proudly bragged of them: for he ſayd, that in the ſtrength and might of hys owne arme, he had eſtabliſhed the kyngdome of <hi>Babilon.</hi>

For men whiche are deſtitute of faith, do not aſcribe thoſe good thinges vnto god, which they thinke they haue attayned vnto by any labour or induſtrie. Yea and they aſcribed the chaunces of warre not to come by the fauour of God, but by ſtrength and pollicye, and ſometymes by fortune. Wherfore <hi>Cicero</hi> in his boke of diuination affirmeth that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Decianes</hi> whiche they gotte by vowing of them ſelues to the people of Rome,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cicero.</hi> Howe Cicero interpreteth the vowing of the Decianes.</note> was an excellent and polliticque deuiſe of warre. So farre is he from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing it to the prouidence of the gods. They knew (ſayth he) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength &amp; force of the Romayne people was ſuch that if they ſawe their captaynes either to be in extreme daungers, or els to be ſlayne, or to be taken of their enemyes, that they would by no meanes ſuffre ſuch diſhonor, and thincking with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues by that meanes to ſtay the flight, they thruſt them ſelues into the thickeſt of their enemies, ſetting before them the ſhewe of their vowe and religion. So that by that meanes the harts of the ſoldiours in maner diſcouraged might be called agayne more fierſly to fight with their enemyes.</p>
                  <p>But we are taught by the holy Scriptures, that when we either ſee or heare of any that are conquerours, or els are ſlayne in battailes, we muſt by and by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe vnto God al that whiche is, or hath ben done, who (after the moſt accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med phraſe of the holy Scriptures) is ſayd to deliuer them whiche are ouercome into the handes of their enemies.<note place="margin">God without any iniury deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uereth ſome in to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of their enemies.

                  </p>
                  <p>When it is ſayd that any are deliuered of God into the handes of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes we muſt thincke that that is done without any iniurye. And as touchyng this place we know that thoſe nations of the <hi>Chananites</hi> were full of moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wickedneſſe, and for that cauſe, god puniſhed them moſt iuſtly. Whiche cauſe is confirmed by that whiche we read in the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where God bringeth a reaſon, why he held the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tyme in Egipt,

For ſometymes he doth this in geuing them ouer to be vexed with luſtes and filthy affections as to certein furyes of hell.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> God puniſheth ſynnes with ſynnes.</note> And that is it which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> oftentimes ſayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſinnes are puniſhed with ſinnes. So <hi>Pharao</hi> hys vnfaythfulneſſe and cruelty was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by hardning &amp; ſtubborneſſe of harte. And Idolaters as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth to the <hi>Romaines:</hi> were geuen ouer of god to their owne filthy luſt, ſo that they moſt vylie contamined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with moſt horrible ſinnes. But bycauſe this kynde of puniſhement is not ſene nor felte of mad men, as it is mete, god therfore deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the vngodly, into the handes of ſtraunge enemies, to be vexed, and at the length vtterly to be deſtroyed. And that this order was obſerued with the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites,</hi> the Scripture manifeſtly teacheth, for they were not onely addicted to Idoles, but as it is written in the xviii. &amp; xx. chap. of <hi>Leuit:</hi> They miſerably defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them ſelues with inceſtes &amp; moſt filthy luſtes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>God deliuered them into their handes.</hi> That is, into their power. This is not onely an Hebrew phraſe, but alſo a latine: for we ſay, This is my hande, that is, it lyeth in my power.</p>

                     <hi>They ſmote them with the mouth of the ſword.</hi> This is a Metaphor in this maner of ſpeche, very often tymes vſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures, wherin by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the ſword we ought to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the edge therof, bycauſe it ſemeth to deuour and conſume thoſe thinges whych are ſmytten, in maner lyke a mouth.

Neither ought this to be vnderſtand thus, as though they had then burned the whole citye. For it is wrytten in the booke of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and afterward it ſhal be expounded in this booke, that that city was after that inhabited by the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> yea and the caſtle therof which was very wel fenſed was not deliuered vp to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,<note place="margin">The city of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken when Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua was yet a lyue.</note> tyl in <hi>Dauid</hi> his time, as it is declared in the latter booke of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought that to moue you bycauſe it appeareth not in the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> that the city of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was taken.

Al theſe thinges I ſay are ſignes that the city was taken at that tyme, although it was not yet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fully and in al partes.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth alſo ſomewhat obſcure, that it is wrytten that <hi>Iudah</hi> deſcended, when he ſhould go fight againſt the <hi>Chananites,</hi> who dwelled on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaines. When as we accuſtome in going to mountaines to aſcend, and not to deſcende. But we muſt vnderſtand that thoſe countries wer ful of mountaines.

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion but of three: for in the booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> &amp; .23. chap. we reade that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sara</hi> wer buried there, &amp; alſo in the .35. &amp; .49. chap. of the ſame booke we rede of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebeckaes</hi> burial there. And laſtly in the .50. chap. we fynde that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was caried thither, &amp; he him ſelfe before that had there buried his wife <hi>Lea.</hi> But concerning <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eue</hi> his wife, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue added vnto theſe, we can finde nothing thereof in the holye ſcriptures. For that which they alledge out of the .14. chap. of Ioſua maketh nothing to the purpoſe, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the word <hi>Adam</hi> in that place is not the name of the firſt man. Wherfore they can gather nothyng
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18396:21"/> out of that place, but that <hi>Arba</hi> was a certaine great man among the <hi>Anakims.</hi> Theſe are the words there: <hi>Ha Adam Hagadol be Anakim Hui,</hi> that is: he was a great man among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Enakims.</hi> But our interpretour tranſlateth it thus: <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> was counted the great among the <hi>Enakims.</hi> Wherby it appeareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he thought that <hi>Adam</hi> was a proper name. But he was two wayes deceaued: firſt he dyd not marke that the article <hi>Ha</hi> is ioyned to the word <hi>Adam,</hi> which is neuer ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with proper names. Wherfore it muſt needes be a common name, whych muſt be referred to that woord <hi>Arba,</hi> for that name was put a litle before. The other errour is bycauſe we reade no where that the firſt man was reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Enakims,</hi> that is to ſay Giauntes.</p>
                  <p>The opinion of others is that <hi>Hebron</hi> was called the City <hi>Arba,</hi> bycauſe it was inhabited of .4. Giauntes, namely <hi>Seſay, Ahimman,</hi> and <hi>Thalmay</hi> vnto which three brethren they adde <hi>Annak</hi> their Parent. But the opinion of theſe men is eaſely confuted, bycauſe that in the .14. chap. of <hi>Ioſua</hi> toward the end, it is by manifeſt wordes declared that this word <hi>Arba</hi> is the proper name of a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt. Wherfore it is manifeſt enough that this woord muſt not be referred to the number of four. And by that meanes not onely this latter ſentence, but the firſt alſo is confuted, which would haue this name <hi>Arba</hi> to haue a reſpect to the foure couple of men with their wyues, buried in the old tyme in that City. And vndoubtedly for the ſame cauſe alſo, the opinion of others is not to be allowed, which do thinke that the City was ſo called, bycauſe although it were but one City, yet it conſiſted of foure Cities, and that this woord <hi>Arba</hi> is all one wyth this greeke woorde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whiche is foure Cities. Wherefore I iudge it beſt to thyncke that it was ſo named of the buylder thereof named <hi>Arba,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arba had three chyldren.</note> who how he came by that ſurname it is vncertaine. Onely this we maye gather out of the ſcriptures, that what ſo euer he was, he had three chyldren which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this place and alſo in the booke of <hi>Ioſua, Sehai, Ahimman</hi> and <hi>Thalmay.</hi> And it is very lykely that they were deade long tyme before <hi>Ioſua.</hi> And when they were now dead, then was there mencion made of them, bicauſe their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which ſeme to haue bene of a wonderful huge ſtature were deſtroyed by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi> and <hi>Othoniel.</hi> And this is the reaſon why I ſuppoſe that theſe three brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liued not in <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Othoniels</hi> tyme, bycauſe this Citye as it is written in the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> was a moſt auncient city, and was buylt .vii. yeares before <hi>zoham</hi> that is, <hi>Thamin</hi> the kingly Citye of the Egiptians. And in <hi>zoham</hi> dyd <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> woorke the wonders before <hi>Pharao.</hi> And if ſo be it was the kingly and noble city then, it muſt nedes be built long time before. Wherefore if <hi>Hebron</hi> were built before it, and had the name thereof of <hi>Arba,</hi> how could his children be on lyue at this time? It cannot be ſo. Beſides thys, <hi>Abraham</hi> had a lodging in this City, &amp; bought there a double caue. And from that time to <hi>Ioſua</hi> his time wer almoſt .400. yeres. It is not therefore very likely, that the ſonnes of him which builded ſo auncient a city ſhould lyue tyl <hi>Ioſua</hi> his tyme, vnles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man wyl fayne that the ſame city was built long time before, &amp; called by an other name, &amp; then in proceſſe of tyme caſting away the firſt name, it ſhould be named by this moſt ſtrong and mighty Giaunt. But whether it be thus or no, neither ſkilleth it much, neither ſemeth it curiouſly to be ſought for.</p>
                  <p>But this might ſomwhat moue ſome, bycauſe <hi>Arba,</hi> wherof we now ſpeake, is called in the .15. chap. of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> the father of <hi>Enak.</hi> For if he had .3. ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes which were named as well here as in the ſame booke of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> it wil then he doubtfull who that ſame <hi>Enak</hi> was.<note place="margin">What Hanack ſignifieth.</note> In which thyng (ſauyng the iudgement of a better learned) I would thinke might be anſwered, that it was not a proper name but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, wherby at that time men of huge ſtature, but ſuch as were noble &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently adourned, wer called. For this word <hi>Enak</hi> in hebrewe is to gird or to
<pb facs="tcp:18396:22"/> compaſſe, and is chiefly referred to chaines which are worne about the necke for comelynes ſake. And thereof is this name <hi>Enak</hi> deriued, &amp; in the plural number hath both the maſculine &amp; feminine forme, &amp; it ſignifieth a chaine, and is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to noble &amp; worthy men, whom thou mayſt cal chained. Wherfore <hi>Seſay, Ahimman</hi> &amp; <hi>Thalmay</hi> may be called the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of <hi>Arba,</hi> who was not called the father of them onely, but alſo the father of <hi>Enak,</hi> bycauſe euery one of his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes was noble,<note place="margin">Why giauntes were called Enakim</note> &amp; wore a chaine, or was a Giaunt, for Giauntes alſo were called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakim,</hi> either bicauſe they wore chaines, or els bycauſe they were of a notable ſtature of body, for it may be that that word was applyed to all kynde of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                  <p>Here is wont to be demaunded, how theſe cities <hi>Hebron</hi> and <hi>Debir</hi> ſhould be written in the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> to haue ben taken of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> when as it is here put that <hi>Chaleb</hi> conquered them,<note place="margin">Chaleb deſired to haue theſe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gions aſſigned him for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce.</note> whereunto I aunſwere that all that warre was gouerned by the conduicte of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> who was the chief and principall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the whole hoſte, but the principall ſettyng forward agaynſt <hi>Hebron</hi> and other places adioyning thereunto was committed vnto <hi>Chaleb</hi> the chief of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and that not without a cauſe. For he, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the xiiii. chap. of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> deſired to haue that parte aſſigned peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto hym for hys inheritaunce: whiche requeſtes he eaſely obtayned. For he required the ſame, truſting to God hys promiſes:<note place="margin">Chaleb was a faithfull eſpye.</note> for when he was ſent with other ſpyes to view the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> he faithfully made relation of the things as they wer in dede, &amp; not vnfaithfully as his fellowes did. Neither was he an author of the peoples ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the other were, yea he rather encouraged the peoples myndes, and diminiſhed thoſe thinges whiche his fellowes had am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified concerning the fence of the cities, of the giau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes alſo, and of the ſtrength of the <hi>Chananites.</hi> For he regarded not ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſtrength, but with a ſingular faith, moſt conſtantly remembred the power, the goodneſſe &amp; promiſes of god. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god being angry with the reſt, deſtroyed them in the wilderneſſe, ſo that they came not to the promiſed lande. But he promiſed <hi>Chaleb</hi> for his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this inheritaunce, whiche when he afterward demaunded, he put <hi>Ioſua</hi> in remembraunce of the thyng before done, and of the promiſes of God.<note place="margin">God promiſed Chaleb the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whereon he ſhould treade.</note> And the place where the promiſe is contayned is in the 14. chap. of <hi>Num.</hi> there God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that land wheron his foote ſhould treade, whiche wordes the Iewes thincke thus to be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. The reſt of the ſpyes being amaſed for feare of the giauntes, and putting ſmall confidence in god durſt not entre into the citie of <hi>Hebron,</hi> whiche <hi>Chaleb</hi> him ſelfe ſearched with a valiaunt courage. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe therfore of this poſſeſſion was made vnto him in the ſecond yeare after the deliuery out of <hi>Egypt.

                  <p>And here ariſeth no ſmall doubt, howe <hi>Chaleb</hi> being of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebron was one of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of refuge.</note> could obtayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Hebron</hi> which by lotte belonged to the <hi>Leuites.</hi> For god had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that certain cities as wel beyond <hi>Iordane</hi> as on this ſide, ſhould be had for refuge ſake,<note place="margin">The cities of refuge belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to the Leuites</note> that thither might flye as many as had ſlayne any man by chaunce, and not of pretenſed purpoſe.

                     <note place="margin">The Leuites had the citie of Hebron, but Chaleb had the grounde and Lordſhip.</note> ſeing it was numbred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the cities of refuge.

                     <hi>And Chaleb ſayd: he that ſmiteth.</hi> This whole hiſtory is declared in the <hi>15.</hi> chap. of the booke of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> word for word, wherby it appeareth that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is moſt certain whiche I before admoniſhed you of,<note place="margin">The conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of Debit was harde.</note> namely that all theſe thinges are now mencioned by a certain repeticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Yea and the Iewes agree not in it among them ſelues, neither doo they onely vary one from an other, but our writers alſo write nothing like one to an other of it. <hi>Lyranus</hi> doth vtterly deny that they wer brethren, which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les <hi>Paulus Burgenſis</hi> affirmeth, yea &amp; that more is, <hi>Lyranus</hi> agreeth not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym ſelfe, for as in the interpreting of the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> hee denyeth that they were brethren, ſo afterward vpon the firſt booke of <hi>Paral.</hi> in the ſecond &amp; fourth chap. he graunteth they wer brethren. But when I more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly weigh the reaſon why in the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> he contendeth that they were not brethren, I gather it to be this, bicauſe he thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they had ben ioyned together with ſo neare a bond of kinred, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther could haue ben no mariage, wherby <hi>Othoniel</hi> ſhould haue had to wife <hi>Hachſah</hi> his brothers daughter, ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was forbidden by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe (namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:18396:26"/> And often tymes the prerogatiue of the men and baſer condicion of the wyues altereth the thing. For in matrimony man is the head of the woman, as <hi>Paule</hi> hath ſaid in the firſt to the <hi>Corinth.</hi>

Which honeſty ſhould he violated if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might take to wife hys Aunt, his vncles wife, or mothers ſiſter. For bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that women ioyned vnto vs by this degree of kynred are to be reuerenced as mothers.

This is moſt certain if <hi>Othoniel</hi> wer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of <hi>Chaleb</hi> his brother, the mariage then was very lawfull.

But of this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter I will not write much at this preſent, ſeing that I haue largely entreated of it in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians. This will I ſaye more ouer, that a good man ought in contracting of matrimonyes, to follow chiefly that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and not lightly to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable orders &amp; vſuall cuſtomes which are not agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god.

Howbeit the magiſtrate, although concerning matrimonie he maye forbid cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other contractes beſides thoſe which God hath forbidden, yet can he not, neither ought he to remit any of thoſe which God hath commaunded, &amp; whiche he hath prohibited by his law, yea he muſt moſt diligently ſee that he burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not the people to much,<note place="margin">The pope hath grieuouſly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concerning theſe lawes.</note> or without an earneſt cauſe, as we ſee the Pope hath done, who hath two wayes ſinned in this thing: fyrſt in that he durſt vſurpe the office of making of lawes in a common wealth, which vndoubtedly pertaineth not vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him, Secondly bicauſe in his lawes he followed not the word of god, but with out reaſon forbad fyrſt al degrees euen to the ſeuenth, which when he ſaw after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was not obſerued, and al was ful of confuſion, he cut of his prohibitions to the fourth degree. In which thing he is yet conſtant &amp; hardened, if there come no money in, but if money be offred (wherof he muſt haue much brought hym to fyl his filthy cofers) he ſetteth at libertie as pleaſeth him, both his own lawes and the word of god.</p>
                  <p>This we muſt alſo knowe, that God had in his lawes an other decree whiche may lawfully be called peculiar, bycauſe it extendeth no way to other nations, neither ought it to be in force at all tymes. And that was, that when any huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band deceaſed without children, the brother which remained on liue, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther next of kynne, ſhould mary the firſt mans wife left, ſo that the firſt childe which ſhould be begotten of that mariage ſhoulde be counted the ſonne of hym that was dead, and ſhould fully ſuccede him as touching his inheritaunce. For God would not in that publique wealth, that men ſhould altogether be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and he prouided that the ſame diſtinction of landes ſhoulde be kepte as much as might be. And ſeing the ſame is not vſed in our publique wealthes, neither hath God commaunded that it ſhoulde, it therfore pertayneth nothyng vnto vs. Wherfore we muſt keepe oure ſelues vnder the generall and common lawe,<note place="margin">She that is left of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to he maryed.</note> namely that no man preſume to mary the wife of his brother being dead although he dyed without children.</p>
                  <p>Let vs alſo knowe that in the beginning, when onely the familie of <hi>Adam</hi> lyued on the earth, brethren were not forbidden as they were afterwarde

<pb facs="tcp:18396:29"/> eſchewed to contracte with perſons ſo nigh: but he ſaith that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> licence was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward taken away. Which I ſurely can not perceaue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

And that is found at this day writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the boke called <hi>Codex Theodoſianus,</hi> concerning inceſtuous mariages, by theſe wordes. Let this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence remaine concerning them, whoſoeuer from henceforth ſhall defyle hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the mariage of his couſin <hi>Germaine,</hi> or of his ſiſters daughter, or of his brothers daughter, or of his wiues daughter, laſtly of al whoſe mariage is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and condemned.

Yea and long before <hi>Gregorye</hi> his time, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath in his <hi>66.</hi> Epiſtle <hi>ad Paternum,</hi> condemned the mariage of brethrens children, &amp; he teſtifieth that it was forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> which I haue alſo brought. And if I ſhould vſe coniecture, I thinke <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did it by the perſuaſion of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who had a ſingular reſpecte to publique ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie. Neither was that law ſo ſeuere at that time, but that ſometimes it might be releaſed as he declareth in that Epiſtle to <hi>Paternus.</hi> In that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> affyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth there that ſuch mariages were prohibited by Gods lawe, It can be made probable to none, which ſhall attentiuely conſider the wordes of the law of god, and doings of the fathers. How the <hi>Romanes</hi> haue behaued themſelues, toward their couſins, as concernyng matrimonyes in the old time, this I haue obſerued <hi>Liguſtine</hi> ſayth in the <hi>2.</hi> booke and <hi>5.</hi> decade of <hi>Liuy,</hi> that his father gaue him his Vncles daughter to wife. <hi>Cicero</hi> alſo writeth in hys oration for <hi>Cluentius,</hi> that <hi>Cluentia</hi> had lawfully maryed her couſin <hi>Germaine M. Aurius.</hi> And <hi>M. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Philoſopher tooke to wife <hi>Fauſtina</hi> his couſin <hi>Germaine,</hi> as <hi>Iulius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolinus</hi> teſtifieth. And before <hi>Rome</hi> was builded the mariages of <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Lauinia</hi> were in hand, which came of two ſiſters. Howbeit <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth in the place aboue mentioned, that at the fyrſt when <hi>Rome</hi> was builte, it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by a lawe, that they whiche were nighe of kinne ſhoulde not marrye together. But yet he writeth that the lawe for brethren and ſiſters chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was vppon thys occaſion releaſed, bycauſe a certayne man beyng both honeſte, and alſo well beloued of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was greuouſlye oppreſſed with pouertye toke to wife his ſiſters daughter which was ryche, and welthye, for the whiche cauſe he was accuſed of inceſte. But the matter being decided, he was quyted by the iudgemente of the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> for he was greatly fauoured in the citye. Then after that, it was decreed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> that from thence forth it ſhoulde be lawfull for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters children to marry together. Theſe thinges I thought good to declare of this kinde of matrimonye both out of Gods lawes, and the old &amp; new lawes of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and alſo out of the fathers and eccleſiaſticall Canons.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18396:29"/> Whereunto I will adde that there be very many Cities profeſſing the goſpell whiche do not admitte the mariages of brethren and ſiſters children, as <hi>Surike, Berna, Baſile, Schapuſin, Sangallum, Biema, &amp;c.</hi> In the kingdome alſo of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land when I was there, that degree was excluded from matrimony. Wherfore in places where the magiſtrate forbyddeth theſe mariages the faithful ought for thoſe cauſes whiche I haue before declared to abſtayne from them.</p>
                  <p>But now I will go to the preſent matter, If <hi>Othoniel</hi> as I haue before ſayd were couſin vnto <hi>Achſa,</hi> he might mary her by the lawe of God: but if he were her vnckle, it was not lawful by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawe. But he maried her. Wherfore we muſt nedes ſaye one of theſe two thinges: either that it was a faulte, for the fathers as we haue before ſayd were not alwayes free from ſinne: or elles that god would haue this done by a priuilege or certain prerogatiue, whiche we may not for all that take example by. Neither is this to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner of Scriptures,<note place="margin">Kinſfolkes in ſcriptures are called brethren</note> they whiche were any way of kinne together were called brethren, as <hi>Loth</hi> is called the brother of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; the kinſfolkes of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the ſonne of God are called in the hiſtory of the goſpel his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So may it alſo be in this place that <hi>Othoniel</hi> may be called the brother of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb,</hi> when as he was but only ſome other waye of kinne vnto him. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretours do vſe this expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times, which I would not diſallow, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſe this particle in the texte, <hi>The yonger,</hi> whiche is not wont to be added, but when ſiſters and brethren in dede are compared together. But now wil I go to other thinges whiche are to be conſidered in this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chaleb</hi> had promiſed him which ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quere the citie of <hi>Debir,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whether Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lebs promiſſe were a raſhe promiſſe.</note> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to wife. What if any wicked perſone had performed that, ſhould he by the vertue of the promiſe haue ben made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne in law of <hi>Chaleb?</hi> ſurely it ſemeth not. For what other thing had this ben, than to betraye his daughter? Therfore it may appeare that he promiſed raſhly. For a wiſe man ought to foreſee thoſe thinges whiche might happen. How be it we muſt conſider that there were not at that tyme ſuch wicked and flagitious men among the Iſraelites, for as long as thoſe elders lyued, whiche gouerned the publicque wealth together with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua,</hi> as it ſhalbe declared in this hyſtory, the people feared god. Wherfore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that they vſed to put thoſe to death by the lawe whiche were guiltie of very grieuous crimes. Therfore there was no daunger leſt any ſuch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould conquere the citie, to whom for that act <hi>Hacſah</hi> ſhould be geuen to wife of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. But if there remayned certaine ſmal and common faultes in him which had conquered it, the ſame might be recompenced by his other vertues. For there is is none ſo abſolute and perfect, but that ſome times he may fal. Moreouer there were ſome hope of amendement of life. And the conquerour might be ſo nighe of kynne, as peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture this <hi>Othoniel</hi> was, that he could not mary the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Chaleb.</hi> Wherfore it ſeemeth that at the leaſt in that part it was a raſhe promiſe. But I do not thincke it can be accuſed of raſheneſſe,<note place="margin">A conſtant rule of all humane promiſes.</note> for as much as all promiſes ought among the godly ſo farre forth to be of force, as they do agree with the word of god, which thing if <hi>Iepthe</hi> had diligently conſidered, he would neuer haue ſuffred hym ſelfe to haue committed ſo vnworthy thinges agaynſt his daughter. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition ſurely in all couenaunts and promiſes ought to be counted for a moſt conſtant rule.</p>
                  <p>We gather alſo hereby, that it is lawfull to go about a wife by iuſt wayes and meanes, as we ſe <hi>Othoniel</hi> now to haue done: and as alſo holy <hi>Dauid</hi> did,<note place="margin">A man by iuſte meanes may go about a wife.</note> who did not only kill <hi>Goliah</hi> the giau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but alſo he gaue <hi>Saule</hi> an hundreth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynnes of the Philiſtianes, for the obteyning of <hi>Michol</hi> to wife.

Now of days they do not ſo,<note place="margin">Howe a ſonne in a lawe ſhould be ſought.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſerable daughters are very often tymes betrayed by their parentes, and very many mariages haue vnhappy ſucceſſe.

                  <p>And this being thus finiſhed and concluded, we muſt diligently take hede,<note place="margin">Whiche end is to be preferred before the reſt.</note> that when many endes are ſet before vs, we may preferre that before the reſt, whiche by good right excelleth the reſt. For if it ſhould be otherwiſe done, and if thoſe thinges whiche are hindermoſt and of ſmaller valew ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the better, we ſhould be iuſtly condemned for peruertyng the order of thinges. Wherfore we muſt take hede, that we directe not God him ſelfe or the worſhipping of him, either to our owne commoditie, or els to any other endes. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould that ſurely happen vnto vs which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth ſo ſore deteſt,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould haue the fruition of thoſe things which we only ought to vſe, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe we ſhould vſe thoſe things which we ſhould haue the fruition of, than which peruerſeneſſe in humane actions no worſe thyng ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be thought.<note place="margin">What is the chief peruerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of humane actions.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it is demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, whether it be lawful in well doyng to haue a reſpect to the gayne or rewarde. We can not well deny but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is lawfull: for as much as god him ſelfe hath promiſed a reward to them whiche lyue godly: neither did God that for any other cauſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his giftes and allurements to ſtirre vp men to iuſt, good, godly and holy workes.<note place="margin">Neither is the rewarde onely to be deſired, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief partes muſt be aſcribed vnto it</note> But although we do not vniuſtly in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a regarde vnto the reward offred vs by God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are occupied in good workes: yet this is diligently to be taken hede of, that we be not moued onely bycauſe of the rewarde whiche is offred vs. Neither is this ſufficient, for if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would ſay that he would in doing good both obtayne the rewarde ſet forth, and by the ſame worke obey God, he muſt take hede, that he attribute not the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt partes to the gift or rewarde, bycauſe alwayes (as I haue already ſayd) that among the endes eche of them as he is more excellent by nature, ſo ought it to be preferred in the firſt place. And in this there nedeth a ſingular diligence: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it oftentimes happeneth, that we deceaue our ſelues, falſly ſuppoſing that nothing is more excellent or dearer to our mindes than god, from whom neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe we are by litle and litle withdrawen and plucked backe by reaſon of to much deſire and delite of reward or gift. Wherfore it afterward happeneth,<note place="margin">If we preferre other things be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore god we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre into grie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> that we come to great miſeries therby: For when god perceaueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we more eſteme thoſe thinges, whiche ought to be of leſſe eſtimation with vs, he withdraweth them away, leſt they ſhould more and more plucke vs away from him. Whiche thing happened many tymes to the Iſraelites, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom God ſometymes toke away riches, libertie, and the promiſed lande, to call them agayne to him ſelfe, whom they leſſe eſtemed than their riches, poſſeſſions, and alſo Idols. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe thinges being marked and obſerued whiche I haue rehearſed, I doubt not but that it is lawfull for godly men after the ſincere &amp; earneſt deſire of God to do good for rewarde and gift.</p>
                  <p>Neither am I ignoraunt that <hi>Bernarde</hi> writeth in his litle booke of louyng of God, that charitie by it ſelfe can not be empty, althoughe it behold no reward.<note place="margin">Bernarde.</note> &amp;c. By which words he putteth vs in mynde of two things: both that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of charitie in them ſelues haue ſo much delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pleaſure and commoditie, as may be ſufficient for them whiche lyue well, although of that their well doyng they ſhould haue no other rewarde geuen them of God. And that we in louyng
<pb facs="tcp:18396:31"/> of God ſhould looke for no other reward, but this, that he according to his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wil not ſuffer, but faithfully to rendre thoſe things which are to be re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred vnto vs. And therfore no man ought chiefly to be moued with the deſyre of the rewarde.<note place="margin">A compariſon of the loue of the children &amp; of the wife.</note> And he addeth, that he doth farre preferre the loue of the wyfe toward her huſband before the loue and obeyſaunce wherwith the children loue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as much as the ſonnes do ſo loue their father, bycauſe they hope they ſhalbe enriched of him by his inheritaunce: wherfore their loue (as he thincketh) is not ſo pure. But the wife if ſhe be ſuch a one as ſhe ought to be, ſhe wiſheth good to her huſband for his owne cauſe and his owne ſake, although ſhe hopeth or looketh to obtayne no good at his hand. Many haue thought that the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this father ought to be allowed, &amp; haue gone about to make playne the ſame by a certain diſtinction not ſo circumſpectly inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by them in my opinion: for they affirme that we may meaſure God or his nature by our worthynes, or that we may beholde him, according as our perfection &amp; vprightneſſe is. Moreouer they ſay that we muſt do what ſoeuer we do, for his ſake in the firſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not in reſpect that he is our chief goodneſſe and felicitie. And this they thincke that <hi>Bernarde</hi> ment by the wordes now alledged. For they bryng theſe words which he writeth in another place,<note place="margin">We muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip god alſo in that he is our felicitie &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</note> namely that he ſuſpected al that loue wherewith we loue any thing beſides God. But theſe men do not marke that by this diſtinction, which is founde out rather by the iudgement of men, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the veritie of the Scriptures, that they are agaynſt the ſentence of God. For he ſayd vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> as it is written in <hi>Gen.</hi> I am thy reward and that very ample: walke thou therfore before me, &amp; be perfect, vndoubtedly by theſe wordes God offreth him ſelfe vnto vs, not imagined by him ſelfe, or plucked away from our commodities, but in reſpect that he is our rewarde.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, as I ſayd now at the firſt, god would not adioyne promiſes, gifts and rewardes to his commaundementes, in vayne or without effect, but adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and moſte wiſely. Did he that I praye thee that we ſhould cloſe our eyes and ouerſkip them?<note place="margin">To looke for a rewarde ſet forth vnto vs by God is not only of ſuch as are vnperfecte.</note> I thincke not. Neither canſt thou ſay that they ſerue for the ruder ſorte, and ſuch as be not yet abſolute and perfect: for I will demaunde ſtrayght waye of thee, whether <hi>Abraham, Moyſes, Dauid,</hi> the Prophetes and Apoſtles were not ſo perfect, as either the nature of men in this life can be, or is required of vs? If thou wilt ſay they were imperfect, then can not I tell what excellencye or perfection of men thou fayneſt to thy ſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> certainly ſetteth forth him ſelfe vnto ythers as a perfect man, in ſuch ſorte, as a man may in this lyfe be perfect, when he wrote be ye perfect as I am perfect. I ſpeake not how the Scripture yea god him ſelfe pronounceth <hi>Moyſes</hi> to be moſt meeke, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo that he was made accordyng to his will and harte. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt graunt that theſe were notable excellent and perfect men (as men may be in this world) neither canſt thou deny the promiſes and rewardes offred to them of god. This without doubte followeth that men of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſorte may in well lyuing and doyng lift vp their eyes to the rewarde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note>And I thincke <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath trimely made manifeſt this thing where as he ſayth in his booke of confeſſions, he loueth thee not (ſpeaking to God) whiche loueth any thing beſides thee,<note place="margin">We may loue gayne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes for gods ſake.</note> which he loueth not for thy ſake. By theſe words is gathered, that we may loue gayne and rewardes for gods ſake: for it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to embrace the meane endes for the laſt and chief goodneſſe. Neither are we forbidden but that we may ſometymes wiſhe for meat, drincke, and cloth, and ſuch thinges as are nedefull for this lyfe, yea and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath commaunded by expreſſe wordes that we ſhould aſke them, and he hath promiſed them to thoſe whiche ſeke for the kyngdome of God: for he hath ſayd, firſt ſeke the kingdome of God and theſe thinges ſhalbe miniſtred vnto you. Wherfore it is true, that theſe may be ſo hoped for, regarded and receaued of God as gifts and rewardes, and not as the principall thinges. For they alſo are to be referred to a farther

I coulde make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a great many beſides, to ſhewe, that all the men in the olde time allowed not, that huſbandes ſhould haue doweryes geuen them when they maried their wyues. But certainly the lawes of God make mention very oftentymes of a dowery. And I am aſſured that it was vſed ſomewhere before the lawe. In <hi>Exodus,</hi> he which had defiled a virgin, was bound to mary her, ſo that her father were content: which if he were not, then was he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to geue her a dowery, as the lawe ſayth the dowery of virgins is. Furthermore in the firſt booke of kinges .ix. chap. <hi>Pharao</hi> gaue for a dowery vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> which had maryed his daughter <hi>Gazar,</hi> a citie whiche he had taken from the <hi>Chananites.</hi> Beſides this the <hi>Romane</hi> lawes, whiche otherwiſe are moſt ful of equitie of all other lawes, do make much mention of doweryes, and haue many whole titles, in whiche this thing onely is entreated of.</p>
                  <p>But now ſeyng we are come thus farre,<note place="margin">The definition of a dowery.</note> it were good to defyne what a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, that therby we may the eaſſyer knowe, howe much of godly men is to be attributed vnto it in contracting of matrimonyes. A dowery is a right to vſe things, whiche are geuen to the huſband by his wife, or by others in her name, to ſuſtayne the burthens of matrimonye. And althoughe a dowery be properly ſayd a right of vſyng, yet notwithſtanding thoſe thynges which are geuen vnto the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are oftentimes called by this word dowery. But the end is chiefly to be marked in this definition, namely to ſuſtayne the burthens of matrimonye. It ſemeth alſo that ſeyng the huſband beſtoweth very muche in noryſhyng hys
<pb facs="tcp:18396:33"/> wife, and honeſtly mayntaining her, iuſtice and equitie require that ſomewhat be recompenced vnto him agayne.<note place="margin">An errour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning dowry</note> Wherfore for as much as a dowery hath this foundation of iuſtice, there is no doubt but that it is a thing lawfull. But in it is an error not to be ſuffred, bicauſe ſome are not aſhamed to ſay, that by a dowery concorde betwene man and wife is the eaſelier obtayned.<note place="margin">Frendſhyppe grounded on profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure is weake.</note> This both reaſon and experience teacheth to be moſt falſe. Who is ignoraunt, that that kynde of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whiche hath a reſpect onely to profit, and whiche is founded only vpon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is very fraile and tranſitory? Moreouer experience teacheth, that maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſo contracted that no other thyng be conſidered but onely beautye of the wife, &amp; the dowery, haue very ill ſucceſſe. Wherfore thoſe are reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouerbe,<note place="margin">Agaynſte to great dowryes and ſuch as be againſt all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; honeſty.</note> 
                     <hi>Qui vxores oculis &amp; digitis ducunt,</hi> ſuch as marry wiues with their eyes and fingers: that is whiche are moued onely with beauty and money. Wherfore iuſt lawes ought not to take away dowryes, but ſeuerely to forbid, that they be not to much encreaſed, or that they be not contrary to vertue and honeſtye. Therefore the <hi>Romane</hi> lawes commaunded thoſe doweryes to be cut of, whiche were greater than the abilitie of the geuer could beare, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the <hi>Digeſtes</hi> of the lawe of doweryes. And contrarywiſe we muſt take hede, that the parentes or tutors being ouercome with couetouſneſſe geue not leſſe than honeſty requireth, as it is written in the title <hi>de dote inofficioſa.</hi> And bycauſe doweryes are geuen to ſuſtayne the burthens of matrimony, thoſe can not be excuſed, whiche when they haue receaued them of their wiues, are not affeard afterward to vſe their wyues vnworthily. They be beſides that vniuſte bycauſe they violate the lawe of God, by whiche they ought to loue their wiues as them ſelues and their owne body, when as they will not conueniently helpe them with their owne goods. Yea there be ſome, whiche if they were not letted by publicque lawes would conſume, ſell and vtterly alienate their wiues dowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that ſhould not happen, lawes, chiefly the Romane lawes haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently prouided for: for they decree that the dominion of the dowery ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne with the wiues althoughe the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit &amp; vſe therof as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage ſhould laſt. But what, I pray you, ſhall I ſay of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which do ſuffer ſo grieuous &amp; intollerable burthens of matrimony to be dayly augmented, in to much cokering &amp; flattering of their wiues? Surely they ſinne moſt grieuouſly, for as much as now neither their own patrimony, neither their wiues doweries ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſufficient, they will ſo abound euery way in orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; ſumptuouſneſſe. How beit godly huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds &amp; holy wiues ought to appoint all thinges moderatly. But why thinck we haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes ordained ſo many things, &amp; by ſo many ways co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning doweries?<note place="margin">Why the dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne for the wyues.</note> Bicauſe they would kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out hurt or damage, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they marry &amp; are ioyned together in matrimony.

                     <hi>Iethro</hi> or <hi>Kenite</hi> had done theſe with <hi>Moyſes</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe after the warre of <hi>Amelek</hi> before the law was geuen, he returned into his own countrey as it is written in the xviii. Chap. of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But concerning his returne into his own countrey, there are two opinions,<note place="margin">Of the returne of Moyſes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law into his countrey.</note> both of the Hebrues &amp; our men. Some ſay that he returned to diſpoſe and ſet an order in his domeſticall things, and to make preparation for his familie to iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with the Iſraelites. Which things being al finiſhed almoſt in one yeares ſpace, he returned to his ſonne in lawe, and went together with him and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites to the land of <hi>Chanaan.</hi> And ſo they ſay, although it be ſayd in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye that he departed before, yet it is truely put in the boke of <hi>Num.</hi> that <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſpake with him, in the ſecond yeare from the departure out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> when the tabernacle was then finiſhed, &amp; orders appoynted, wherby the Hebrues ſhoulde go forward. For he deſtred him, not to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but to be as it were an eye
<pb facs="tcp:18396:35"/> to the Iſraelits in this their iourney into ſtraunge countryes, for that he knew all the places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſert very well, bycauſe he was borne in the countrey adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto it. Not bycauſe the pyllers and cloudes led not the Iſraelites ſafely &amp; ſoundly, but bycauſe this man was very cunning in pitching and camping an hoſte. <hi>Moyſes</hi> woulde therfore (as they ſay) haue him to inſtructe the troupes of Souldiours which ſhoulde goe forth, and to prouide that they going forwarde, ſhoulde abyde ioyned together, and ſhoulde keepe the iuſte manner of warlyke order. Whereunto thys alſo was a helpe, for that by reaſon of hys knowledge of the countreyes he coulde eaſely admonyſhe the Iſraelites of the nature of thoſe places, and howe farre diſtante and nyghe they were together. Howbeit other ſay, that <hi>Iethro</hi> ſo returned to hys houſe, after he had reioyced with <hi>Moyſes</hi> that he retourned not vnto hym agayne: for as it is to be beleued, he was very aged, and therfore he ſpent the reſte of hys age with hys neyghbours and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in <hi>Madian,</hi> exerciſyng his office eyther of a prince or ells of a prieſt. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they thynke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he left a ſonne with <hi>Moyſes,</hi> called <hi>Hobab,</hi> to the entente he might be throughly enſtructed by <hi>Moyſes</hi> hys kinneſman, and by <hi>Aaron,</hi> and other excellent men of the Hebrues, in Godlineſſe and knowledge of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God. Therfore they wil haue this man to be he, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſpake vnto in the .x. of <hi>Num.</hi> and made ouerſear for pitching of the campes. Beſides y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this mans ſonnes &amp; familye were now at this preſent called <hi>Kenites.</hi> And I my ſelf, to ſay what I thinke true, do much agree with this latter ſentence.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Balaam</hi> the Prophet in the .24. chap. of <hi>Num.</hi> prophecied peculiarly of the <hi>Kenites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Balaam the Prophet.</note> that they ſhould haue their habitations in the moſt fenced places, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſhould there abide, til they were led away captiues by the <hi>Aſsirians,</hi> &amp; he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them (as it appeareth manifeſtly in that place) with <hi>Amelek:</hi> for (as I ſayd before) they inhabited al one land with the <hi>Amelekites.</hi> Wherfore it is gathered that <hi>Iethro</hi> ſo departed from <hi>Moyſes</hi> into <hi>Madian,</hi> to dwell there continually. And ſo it might be that <hi>Balaam</hi> the Prophet ioyned the <hi>Kenites</hi> with the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi> of which <hi>Kenites</hi> neuertheleſſe part were with the Iſraelites, for as much as <hi>Iethro</hi> (as it is ſayd) left his ſonne with them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this in the .x. chap. of <hi>Num. Hobab</hi> was deſired of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> to come &amp; go with the Iſraelites, whether they went: who refuſed to goe any farther, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was mynded to returne home into his countrey. For he was left there of his father to be better inſtructed in the worſhippyng of God, and he abode with the Iſraelites tyll they were readye to depart thence, And then he thought to haue returned into his countrey: but being deſired of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> he conſented at length to iourney forth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelits. But theſe things could not haue bene ſo, if we ſhould thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Hobab</hi> had bene <hi>Iethro,</hi> which after he had deuided &amp; ſet his things in order ſhould haue returned againe to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to haue gone forward with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelits. For what neded <hi>Moyſes</hi> to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated hym to do that, for which cauſe he came from hys owne houſe to doe? Or why ſhoulde he haue chaunged hys purpoſe to retourne into hys owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treye, whiche he had before vtterly forſaken? Laſtly why ſhoulde he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde haue denyed to goe, which he had before decreed with hymſelf to do? I know in deede there be ſome but not many which affyrme, that <hi>Iethro</hi> was that <hi>Hobab</hi> with whom <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſpake in the booke of <hi>Num.</hi> which thyng let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affyrme for me, howbeit I thought good to declare what I iudged moſt likely.</p>
                  <p>And that the familye of the <hi>Kenites</hi> dwelled long among the <hi>Amelekites</hi> or very nyghe adioynyng vnto them, the fyrſte booke of <hi>Samuel</hi> teſtifyeth, where it is written that <hi>Saule</hi> called forth the <hi>Kenites,</hi> leaſt he ſhould haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them together with the <hi>Amelekites.</hi> Wherefore it ſemeth that parte of the <hi>Kenites</hi> dwelled with the <hi>Amelekites,</hi> &amp; part with the Iſraelits, of whiche both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were alwaies moſt frendly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues. And god declareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly adorned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their publique wealth, &amp; that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> three principal giftes.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18396:35"/> For they excelled in the ſtudy &amp; knowledge of the law.<note place="margin">Three thinges God ſeemeth to haue geuen to the Kenites.</note> They were alſo notable in obtaining of a great victorye. Laſtlye they liued vertuouſly and godlye. And concerning the ſtudy of the law, wherein they flooriſhed, the firſt booke of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipomenon</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſeconde chapter towarde the ende, is a wytneſſe vnto them. For there is mencion made of them with the family of <hi>Iambes,</hi> that is, of <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and they ar ſaid to haue bene Scribes: wherby it appeareth that the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Hebrues</hi> is not to bee deſpiſed, that in the doctrine of the lawe, they were the diſciples of <hi>Othoniel:</hi> for they ar reckoned in his family. And it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common thing, to count diſciples in the place of children.<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> alſo in hys queſtions vpon <hi>Paral.</hi> alloweth this opinion, which (as it is ſaid) ſeemeth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the ſcriptures. Neither do I thynke that for anye other cauſe there is mencion made of them in this place among the actes of <hi>Othoniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why mencion is made here of the Kenites.</note> but onelye by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lyued together alwaies with his family moſt louingly. They ar alſo counted with the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> although they were not of the ſtocke of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites. Wherfore they amongſt other wer a fygure of the callyng of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. The other notable ornament of theirs in that publique wealthe was that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> noble victory, which is declared in the .4. chap. of this booke. For <hi>Iahel,</hi> the wife of <hi>Aber</hi> the <hi>Kenite</hi> ſlew <hi>Siſara</hi> the captayne of warre of <hi>Iabin</hi> king of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> and God would by the hand of a woman of this familye graunt great health to the Iſraelites. Laſtly that they wer wel manered, and obſeruers of their fathers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> commaundementes, the family of <hi>Ionadab</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Rechab</hi> hath declared. They dronke no wyne, which at that tyme was the maner of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayſe of the Rechabites.</note> and notably deſpiſing earthly thinges they dwelled not in houſes, but lyued in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and exerciſed the arte of a ſhepherd which is moſt ſimple. For which thing they are very much commended of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet, and adourned wyth a moſt ample promiſſe aboue the Iewes, bycauſe they had geuen more ſeruice &amp; obedience vnto him namelye <hi>Rechab</hi> their parent, than the Hebrues had done vnto God himſelfe, which neuertheles dyd continually boaſt in that father and holy progenitours. Wherefore we knowe that to be moſt true which <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they in dede had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father, whiche followed the ſteppes of hys fayth, they were not Iewes by nature, but by wyl and faith were made <hi>Proſelites,</hi> and in godlynes and holynes farre paſſed very many of thoſe which were by nature Iewes.</p>
                  <p>We gather moreouer hereby,<note place="margin">It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable for men to ioyne them ſelues to good &amp; godly perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> that it muche auayleth vs to ioyne our ſelues with good men, and with the fellowſhyp of the godly. The <hi>Kenites</hi> which wer the poſterity of <hi>Hobab,</hi> if they would haue reſted (as the moſt part of men do) in their own countrye, and in the place where they were borne, they had fallen at length into the ignoraunce of God and of his lawes, wherby they ſhould eaſely haue bene lyke vnto their neighbour <hi>Amalek.</hi> But bycauſe they deſpiſing theyr owne thinges, and kyndled with the faith of the promiſſe of God, ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the Iſraelites,<note place="margin">What are the moſte honeſt cauſes of pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination.</note> therfore God gaue them ſuche good ſucceſſe in theyr thinges. We ought to remember with our ſelues the moſte honeſt cauſe of the peregrination of theſe men. For al good men trauayle not into ſtraunge coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries for one purpoſe. There be very many, which do therfore often tymes leaue their countrey, bycauſe they may not worſhip God there after the ſincere &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful maner of worſhipping, yea they are grieuouſly troubled there, if they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them ſelues therunto. So <hi>Abraham</hi> was called out of his lande and from hys kynred, leaſt he ſhould ſtyl haue gone forwarde with his elders to contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him ſelfe with idolatry. So Chriſt alſo ſaid, if they ſhal perſecute vs in one city, let vs flye vnto an other. But ther be other, which though they be not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at home from the true godlynes, yet for al that they wil go ſee thoſe places, wher they thinke they may yet get more profyt,<note place="margin">Plato his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination is prayſed.</note> and be more certainlye enſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thinges deuine and neceſſary for ſaluacion. For which cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mended, bycauſe he came to the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> &amp; went to a part of <hi>Italy,</hi> that is great
<pb facs="tcp:18396:36"/> 
                     <hi>Greace:</hi> he went alſo vnto diuers nations, as though he ſhould follow wiſdome flieng from him. So in like wiſe <hi>Saba</hi> the quene is commended in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which trauailed from ſo farre countries to heare <hi>Salomon:</hi> after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Kenites</hi> (of whom we entreate) folowed the people of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for although at home they knew &amp; worſhipped one God, whoſe Prieſt their father alſo was, yet neuertheles they deſired to be ſtyl more inſtructed, and more abſolutelye to receaue the lawes, inſtitutions and worſhipping of God.</p>
                  <p>They are alſo very much worthy of praiſe, which do for this cauſe only tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile into other countries to profyt others, and to helpe and deliuer them from the miſeries wherewyth they be oppreſſed. After which ſorte the Poetes haue ſayd that <hi>Hercules</hi> wandred through the world,<note place="margin">Hercules.</note> by his might to deſtroy wicked and hurtful men, which miſerably afflicted mankinde. Neither did the Apoſtels trauaile throughout the whole worlde for any other cauſe, than to deliuer men out of the mouth of the deuyl, and by the preaching of the Goſpel to looſe them from their chaines of errours. Chriſt alſo for this ſelfe ſame cauſe would trauail and iourney among men, that by his doctrine and death he might delyuer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternal deſtruction. Wherfore the <hi>Kenites</hi> may be numbred with theſe: for they alſo adioyned them ſelues companions with the Iſraelites, to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the deſerte. For (as it is ſaid) they hauing good knowledge of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, might ſtand the Iewes in great ſteede. Theſe counſels are plainlye iudged good and honeſt, for whoſe cauſes peregrinations which are taken wythout co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, are honeſt and prayſe worthy.</p>
                  <p>There maye be other reaſons alſo of peregrination, which as they be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be refuſed, yet are they nothing to be compared wyth theſe, eyther in praiſe, or els in worthynes. Wherfore let godly men take hede when they iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into farre cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, that they apply them ſelues as much as is poſſible vnto theſe cauſes &amp; reaſons now me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned. And as God hath not defrauded theſe <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> of the fruit which they looked for, but made them partakers and that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of thoſe good thinges which he had prepared for his people, ſo ſeyng alſo he is now the ſame God which he was then, we muſt beleue, that he wil not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him ſelfe to depart from his accuſtomed maner and perpetuall goodnes, ſo that we obſerue the good and iuſt cauſes and reaſons of peregrination.</p>

Therefore the ouerthrowing of the city, houſes, men, and beaſtes, did ſhew the iuſtice and ſeueritie of God. And the conſecration declared the goodnes, helpe and mercy ſhewed to that people.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18396:37"/> and knowen to be enemies of God: for it is not lawfull to kyll Innocentes.

                     </note> whether theſe deſtructions of townes wer againſt charity? To whom I anſwer no. Bicauſe ſuch enemies were choſen to be vtterly deſtroyed of the Iewes by the iudgement of God, and not by the luſt of men. But as touching the loue or hatred of enemies, wee muſt vnderſtande that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath written toward the ende of the firſt booke vpon the ſermon of the Lord on the mountaine, that he doth aſcende one ſteppe of righteouſnes, which loueth his neighbour, although he yet hate his enemy. But then ſhall he performe beneuolence and gentlenes at the commaundement of hym whyche came to fulfyl the law, and not to breake it, when he ſhall ſtretch it euen to the loue of the enemy. For that degree, though it be ſomwhat, yet it is ſo ſmal, that it may be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo with Publicanes. Neither that which is ſaid in the law: <hi>Thou ſhalt hate thine enemy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte to hate their enemyes.</note> is to be taken as a commaundement vnto the iuſt man, but as a permiſſion to the weake. Thus much he writeth, with whom (yf I ſhould ſpeake as I thinke) I do not agree, but am certainly perſwaded, that to hate our enemies is not permitted of God, no not to the vnperfect. For it is an euerlaſting precept, that we ſhould loue our neighbour as our ſelues.<note place="margin">Who is oure neyghbour.</note> And he is our neighbour whom we helpe by anye occaſion, as Chriſt hath declared in the parable of the Iewes and of the <hi>Samaritan.</hi> They were compared as enemyes one to an other, wherefore the condition of enmitye when it happeneth, can not let, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch as are enemies one to an other be yet neighbours. Moreouer for as much as we ſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; other prophets did oftentimes curſe their enemies, by what meanes can we cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weake, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God gaue liberty to hate their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For they wer holy men and very perfect.<note place="margin">Auguſtine,</note> Neither doth that ſeeme to make much to the purpoſe, which the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, namely that the ſayinges of theſe holy men were no vowes &amp; deſires, but rather foreſpeakinges &amp; prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of them, who liuing vnder the old teſtament did oftentimes prophecye the chaunce of thinges to come. For the Apoſtels ar alſo found in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not only to haue ſpoken words of curſings (as <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith: I woulde to god they wer cut of which do trouble you) but alſo to haue moſt grieuouſly puni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed ſome. For as much (as it is written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> actes of the Apoſtels) the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> depriued <hi>Elimas</hi> the Magicien of his ſight, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſlewe <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18396:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> Wherfore we muſt rather ſay that theſe great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not ſuch things of an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred graunted to vnperfect men, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wer driuen therunto by ſome other maner of meanes.<note place="margin">Marke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</note> And therfore me thinketh we muſt make this diſtinction, that they ſomtimes had to do for their own cauſes, &amp; ſometimes for gods cauſe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had to do for their matters, al their doings wer ordered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al modeſtye and gentlenes. As we ſe <hi>Dauid</hi> to haue done, who many times ſpared <hi>Saul</hi> his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy. <hi>Moyſes</hi> alſo &amp; other holy men did conſtantly &amp; valiauntly very often grieuous thinges. But when the matters of God wer in hand, the ſame me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued them ſelues ſeuerely &amp; nobly. And if they ſhould haue done that in theyr own cauſes, they might haue ſemed to wreſt the ſwerd out of the hande of God and of the Magiſtrate, which they do which reuenge their own iniuries.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo to be added, that men which are appointed to take in hand &amp; to defend Gods cauſe,<note place="margin">What is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to be taken heede of when Gods matters are in hand.</note> although they may then do thinges ſharpely &amp; ſeuerlye, yet they muſt preciſely &amp; diligently take hede, that vnder that pretence, they cocker not their owne affections. The Apoſtels when they deſired Chriſt to ſende fyre from heauen vpon the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> (as they knew was done in the olde tyme, at the prayers of <hi>Helias</hi>) wer rebuked of the Lord, bicauſe they knew not of whoſe ſpirite they wer, which without doubt was a moſt apt anſwer. For they whom God ſendeth to execute theſe offices, ought not nowe to be counted priuate or ſymple men,<note place="margin">Whether it bee lawfull to pray againſt tyrans &amp; to curſe them <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                     </note> but ſuch as wer prepared and enſtructed of him, to be in hys ſteede vpon the earth. But whether it be lawful for priuate men to praye againſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and cruell Tyrannes, by whom the true worſhipping of God is hindred, and to curſe them, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aunſwereth, that it is alwaies lawfull for godlye men to pray vnto God againſt the kingdome of ſynne. And that maye be cleane taken away, when the vngodly forſake their wickednes, for whoſe vnfayned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce we muſt alwayes pray vnto God. But if they ſeeme paſt all hope, it is lawful to praye that their ſynnes maye ſometymes at the length come to an end: namely that when they are taken awaye, they myght ceaſe both to hynder the woorſhipping of God, and alſo to trouble the Saintes. For as much as it is not expedient that theyr ſynne ſhoulde eſcape vnpuniſhed, for when it is leaſte without puniſhment, it is mere vniuſtice. But when the puniſhment of God is adioyned vnto it, then ther is in him leſſe deformitye. Wherefore God is of the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> called verye wel not a cruell tormentor,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> but a iuſt correctour. Moreouer, bycauſe holy men are very familiar with God, and therefore when by ſome heauenly reuelation,<note place="margin">Saintes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reioyce &amp; alſo are ſory for the deſtruction of the wycked.</note> they are acertained of his wil, bicauſe they excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly loue him, they cannot but allow his ſentence, yea they faithfullye praye that the ſame may be accompliſhed. Although (in that they be men) they be both ſory, and alſo take it grieuouſly to haue their neighbours ſo vexed. After whych ſorte <hi>Samuel</hi> mourned for <hi>Saul</hi> the kyng, whom be knew neuertheles to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of god. <hi>Ieremy</hi> alſo wept for the captiuity which was at hand, and Chriſt wept for the City of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which ſhould be deſtroyed. For they which be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede,<note place="margin">God requireth not the not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ikes.</note> can not choſe but be ſory for their neighbours and their own fleſh when it is afflicted. Neither doth God require of vs that <hi>Stoike</hi> lacke of compaſſion. But as touching this matter, if the Reaver deſire to know more, let hym looke vpon my Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries to the <hi>Corrinthians.</hi> But as touching this preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that is to ſay, that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in deſtroying &amp; curſing of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, followed not their own hatred, but the inſtinction of God, for they wer his Lieuetenauntes, and might be called his woorkemen, when as they deſtroyed thoſe whom god himſelfe had declared to be enemies, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that they ſhould be deſtroyed by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Iudah tooke Hazzam, and the borders therof.</hi> Theſe words do al ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things which ar now declared, wer don after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publique wealth of the Iſraelites was gouerned by elders. For when in the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> the .xiii. chap. thoſe Cities were reckoned which were leaſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18396:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnconquered after <hi>Ioſuas</hi> death, theſe cities <hi>Haza, Aſcalon,</hi> and <hi>Accaron</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by name. But there is a doubt, after what ſorte theſe Cities were ſayde to haue pertained to the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> in the tyme of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> dyd then raigne. Yea and the ſame is written in the third chap. of this booke. There are ſome whiche affirme that theſe Cities were not nowe altogether taken, but ſo poſſeſſed, that the Iſraelites obtained ſome part of the lande which belonged vnto them, which ſemeth not very lykely vnto me, ſeing that the hiſtorye ſayth that not onely euery one of theſe Cities wer taken, but that alſo the endes and borders of them came into the power of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Wherfore I would rather iudge that their opinion is beſt, which affirme that <hi>Iudah</hi> dyd now in deede poſſeſſe theſe Cities, as it is written, but afterwarde when the Iſraelites ſynned, they wer agayne dryuen out of them by the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> who wonne them agayne to their own vſe, and ſo did wynne them, that they counted them as moſt principal dominions, for they dyd ſet ouer eche of them certaine noble gouernours. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought that much to moue vs, bycauſe the hiſtory doth onelye name <hi>Iudah</hi> now, &amp; ſpeaketh nothing of <hi>Symeon.</hi> For that might be, bicauſe the lot of both theſe tribes was ioyned together, and they had made a couenant to fyght toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: therfore when we heare the name of the one, we muſt therwith alſo vnder ſtand the name of the other.

And that they wer horrible to behold, and hard to be conquered, may manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gathered by the booke of <hi>Ioſua:</hi> For ther in the .vii. chap. when the tribe of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> complained bicauſe it was ſo many in number, and had obtained ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a lot, <hi>Ioſua</hi> commaunded them, that if they had not roume inoughe, they ſhoulde go and dwel or els conquere the places of their enemies adioyning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

But to repeate more auncienter thinges, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi> (as it is written in the booke of <hi>Exodus</hi>) when hee perſecuted the Iſraelites which fled, is ſaid to haue had chariotes, and with the ſame he tooke vpon hym to enter into the ſea.

                     <note place="margin">Yron chariotes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſiſt god</note>But this is diligently to be conſidered of vs, whether either yron chariotes, or hooked cartes can withſtand the power and promiſe of God, which if we ſhal deny (as in very dede we muſt deny) why ar they then put here as the cauſe that the victory was not obtained?<note place="margin">Marke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</note> Whereunto I aunſwer, that in this place is ſet foorth vnto vs the nigheſt cauſe, namely that which was ſene. And certainly it was a cauſe, if we ſhould looke onely vpon mans ſtrength. For the <hi>Chananites</hi> being ſo armed and appointed could not be ouercome of the Iſraelites, whych wer weaker than they,<note place="margin">Why god grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted not the hole victorye vnto Iudah.</note> and not ſo wel armed and fenced. But if the power and might of God be conſidered, the ſame could not be letted either by chariots and weapons or els by power of ſouldiours. Why did not God therfore whych had geuen part of the victory, graunt the whole alſo? <hi>Kimhi</hi> aunſwereth that God dyd it to proue the Iſraelites thereby. For if they ſhould haue bene conſtrayned (as in deed they were) to dwel for a while with theſe nations, then experience ſhould haue tryed how much they woulde ſet by theyr God, namelye whether they woulde perſeuer in the lawfull woorſhypping of hym, or whether they would enclyne to their owne madde cuſtomes and woorſhipping of Idoles. Thys in deede is a true cauſe, and is ſet foorth alſo in the thyrd chapter of thys booke, and toward the end lykewyſe of the ſecond. There is alſo an other cauſe added, namely to teach them the arte and faculty of fyghting: for they whych ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before their tyme, had no ſkyll of theſe thynges. And it is written in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> that it was done that wylde beaſtes ſhoulde not to muche abounde, whych muſt needes haue followed, if the land ſhoulde haue bene brought into a wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, before the Hebrues could haue fylled it all. And of theſe cauſes I haue made mention before.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Paraphraſtes Chaldaicus</hi> bringeth an other cauſe beſydes theſe, and ſayth that the chyldren of Iſraell had ſynned: Wherefore he thincketh it was done, that God iuſtlye and woorthylye withdrewe hys ayde and gaue not vnto them when they fought, the whole and full victorye. And that, though the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doo not now expreſſe it, may euidently be gathered by other places. For we are very often taught by the holy ſcriptures that idolatry and ſynnes were iuſt cauſes why the Iſraelites ſometymes went without the victorye promyſed vnto them. And though there had bene no other ſynne, we myght alledge thys, that their faith and prayers were ſometymes ſomewhat more ſlacke than they ought to haue bene.<note place="margin">When faith &amp; praiers waxe fainte, then the victory is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away.</note> Whych manyfeſtly appeareth in that warre which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues made in the wylderneſſe againſte <hi>Amelecke</hi> for the enemye ouercame, when <hi>Moyſes</hi> beganne to be faynte in prayer. And agayne, the victorye was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored vnto the people of God, when the fayth and prayer of <hi>Moyſes</hi> was more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18396:39"/> earneſt and vehement. Sinne therfore is not onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of death, but it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth alſo al infirmities, weakeneſſe and miſeries. Contrarily faith is the cauſe of all ſtrength, myghte, and victories. Wherefore it is very well written in the xi. Chapter to the Hebrues, that the Sainctes through fayth haue wonne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Which may and oughte to be referred to the ſpirituall victorye. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iohn doth faythfully admonyſhe vs, when he ſayth. This is the victorye which ouercommeth the world, euen our fayth.</p>
                  <p>By theſe may be gathered that God leaueth thoſe deſtitute of hys ayde,<note place="margin">God forſaketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that forſake hym.</note> which do forſake hym. And that may eaſely be declared by oure fyrſte Father <hi>Adam.</hi> Who, as he was created of God, before ſynne, he had that power of ſtrength and will, that he myght if he had would haue reſiſted ſynne.<note place="margin">Adam was not altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter hys ſynne.</note> But when he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely fell from God, God alſo forſooke hym, but not vtterly, howbeit he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke hym ſo that he loſt many of hys giftes, and much fauour. For God would not haue taken ſo many good thynges awaye from hym, but that he fyrſte had alienated hymſelfe from God through ſynne. After the ſame ſorte happeneth it to thoſe whiche are nowe borne a new, who although they haue not yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered a perfecte free will, neuertheleſſe for ſo muche as they are ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and may nowe woorke together with God, if they ſhall deſpyſe the gifts whiche they haue in them, and will not vſe them as it is meete they ſhoulde, God will iuſtely forſake them, ſeing they ſhrynke fyrſte awaye from hym. As we maye ſee in the parable of the Lorde, wherein it is written, That the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter going into a farre countrey diſtributed money vnto hys ſeruauntes, to be encreaſed by theyr induſtrye and laboure, whiche thyng as many of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes as dyd, they were both commended of theyr maiſter when he retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and alſo nobelly rewarded. But he whiche deſpyſed the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hys Lorde, was greuouſly reproued, and greuouſly puniſhed, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney committed vnto him.</p>
                  <p>But if we ſhall ſpeake of the fyrſt generation,<note place="margin">Concernyng e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God before they forſake him.</note> whereby we are borne the children of wrath, and we all are of that maſſe, which lieth vnder the curſe, from which God by his election deliuereth whom he will: and whom he will not, he forſaketh according to hys own will and purpoſe, which is alwayes iuſt, though it be hidden from vs. Seing that that is not brought to paſſe by works foreſene, neither that we haue done any good or euill before we were borne, it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that certayne, I meane reprobates, are forſaken of God as touchyng hys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, before that they forſake hym by theyr propre will, for ſo much as they had not it from the beginning. But we at thys preſent, ſpeake not of thys matter, neyther will deſcend into thys queſtion. But that which we haue now affirmed <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath ſet forth in the .14. chap. of his <hi>Soliloquii animae ad deum.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Thou Lord (ſaith he) doeſt not forſake me, vnles I firſte forſake thee. And in his booke <hi>de natura et gratia</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in the .27. and .28. chap. he elegantlye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth after what ſorte God is forſaken of men before hee forſaketh them.<note place="margin">By pride god is forſaken before he forſaketh.</note> Among other vyces (ſayth he) pryde whych is borne in vs, is the head of al euils. Which pryde vſeth then to ſhewe foorth it ſelfe, when wee are doing well, and when we are in the chiefe courſe of the victory. There the vayne hart of man is puffed vp, ſo that euerye man thinketh hym ſelfe not to bee as other men are. Thys is for the moſt parte, the fyrſt departure from God, whereby hee agayne wythdraweth hym ſelfe from vs. And euen as wee doo not departe from hym by ſteppes, but in hart and affection, ſo is he ſeperated from vs, not concerning place, (for, for as muche as he is infinite he occupieth all thynges) but he wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth from vs hys fauour, gyftes, grace, and helpe.<note place="margin">God vſeth alſo to punyſhe the electe to theyr ſaluation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when he is ſo departed, they whych are forſaken, vndoubtedly fal &amp; come to great miſery: which falles yet &amp; miſeries (as he is good) he vſeth as remedies toward his elect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may learne that in the ſame myſery whych before they had forgotten, namely, that their ſtrengthe was ſupported by God, and that it
<pb facs="tcp:18396:40"/> was his mere gifte, in that before they dyd any thing that was good, or attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any proſperous things: that being ſo admoniſhed, they myght retourne into the waye, and with moſte faythfull prayers to emplore of hym helpe, ayde, and ſtrength, as they whiche had nowe proued, by theyr own ill, that they had all theſe thinges of him when they ſtoode. And after thys ſorte is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, whiche the Apoſtle writeth to the <hi>Phil.</hi> With feare and trembling, worke your ſaluation. For it is God whiche worketh in you both to will and alſo to perfourme, accordyng to hys good pleaſure. Wherefore feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng ought alwayes to be driuen into vs, leaſt when thinges goe wel land proſperous with vs we waxe proude, and whileſt we profite in our renouation and inſtauration. Then muſt we alwaies with feare and trembling marke that it is God which worketh in vs both to will and to performe.<note place="margin">We muſt not liue in ſecuritye</note> Neyther dyd the Apoſtle ſay, liue rightly and holily with ſecuritye: For he which is ſecure from himſelf, eſtemeth thinges ſo, as though they depended of himſelf, which is not to be ſuffred, when as it is God himſelfe which worketh in vs both to will and to perfourme.</p>
                  <p>But peraduenture thou wilte aſke, ſeing God from the beginning noblye promyſed vnto <hi>Iudah,</hi> that he would deliuer the land into his handes, and hath not nowe graunted the perfecte victorye,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Whether the wil of god may be chaunged.</note> whether he haue chaunged hys ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? Heare what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth of the will of God in hys .22 booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei</hi> and firſt chap. The will of God (ſayth he) is not chaunged, but we are chaunged. But he ſemeth after a ſort to be chaunged, when where as before he was gentle vnto vs, he now appeareth angry: and contrarilye where as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhewed himſelf to be angry, he now in a manner gently offereth himſelf vnto vs. Wherefore when we our ſelues are chaunged we doe finde him after a ſort, to be chaunged in thoſe things which we ſuffer. Euen as the ſunne ſemeth to be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, when we our ſelues are halfe blind, or that our eyes be greued by ſome diſeaſe. For he which before was pleaſaunt, mery, and ſwete, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now to be troubleſome &amp; hurtfull, not as touching his own nature (which alwaies abideth one, &amp; is vnchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable) but by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our diſeaſe &amp; vice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are newly fallen.<note place="margin">What were the cauſes of the vnperfecte vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye of them of Iudah.</note> Wherefore let vs more plainely gather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnperfect victory. The nigheſt cauſe and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true cauſe was, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Chananites</hi> had Iron chariots: for taking away Gods helpe, the Hebrues were not like vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being ſo wel fenced &amp; appoynted. And god (as <hi>Ionathas</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Chaldeian</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth) withdrewe his fauor &amp; ayde, bycauſe they had ſinned. Wherfore a iuſte pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment followed them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they went without the victory. But God whiche is alwaies very mercifull to his electe, vſeth this punyſhment to the commoditye of the Iſraelites: namely fyrſt to teach them the arte of warfare: then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his ayde, being withdrawen, they might fele their own weakeneſſe, &amp; might ſee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of enemies they ſhould haue to do. Beſides this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the earth might not be waſted of wilde beaſts, &amp; brought into a wilderneſſe. Finally, therby to trye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note>Temptation is nothyng ells, but to take profe or triall of any thyng. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of temptation is ryghtly called knowledge: as they which wil paſſe ouer a water,<note place="margin">The end of temptation.</note> do trye oute the ſhallowe places, to knowe the depth of the water: woundes alſo are tried of Surgeons, to fele the depeneſſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he tempteth, he only doth it, to leade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the knowledge of thoſe things which they ought to knowe.<note place="margin">To what end holy men are tempted.</note> Wherfore when he ſometymes tempteth good &amp; holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he bryngeth into lyght and maketh open the fayth, obedience, ſtrength and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, which before lay hid in theyr hartes, that they which ſee the ſame things, might glorifie God the author of them. And that they which are ſo tempted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue gotten the victory, may geue him thankes, and deſire of him, that euen as he hath done now, ſo he would vouchſafe to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations

Wherfore the ende of theſe temptations is, not that God ſhould know thoſe things, wherof he was before ignoraunt, but that therby his giftes, fauour and grace might not be hidden. But bicauſe ſometimes it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that in temptations, euen the elect are ouercome, god grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth them after their fall, to riſe vp againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne a great deale more modeſt than they were before, which the holy ſcriptures teſtifie to haue bene done in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> The end theyfore of ſuch temptations, is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we knowing our own weakeneſſe, might lay down our Peacockes tayle, and haue a regard to God him ſelfe, as to the fountayne of all good thinges.

                  <p>If temptations turne to good for the godly, why do they praye agaynſt them,<note place="margin">Whether we may pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> when as they pray in the Lordes prayer, Lead vs not into temptation?

<pb facs="tcp:18396:43"/> Moreouer the ſame appeareth in that they were appoynted by the Hebrues to cary and to prepare wood and alſo to draw water for the ſacrifices whiche were done vnto the true God. Therfore they were made labourers and ſeruauntes of the tabernacle, and of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> wherof they were called <hi>Nathinites.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Why god hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the hartes of the Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</note>But the cauſe why God ſo hardned their harts was, bycauſe their ſinnes were ful.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18396:44"/> landes, ſemed to do it iuſtly, and rightfully. Wherefore (as he ſayeth) GOD did both reſtore vnto the Iſraelites the countreys whiche belonged vnto their aunceſtors, and alſo puniſhed the <hi>Chananites</hi> for their wickedneſſe, and this he did all with one and the ſelfe ſame worke. Howbeit I can not eaſely agree to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> opinion, for there was paſt preſcription of very long time, for at the leaſt there were fyue hundreth yeares. Wherefore it could not be ſayde that the <hi>Chananites</hi> poſſeſſed that lande vniuſtly.

And yet for al that they had good ryght therunto for as much as god teſtified as wel by words as by wonderfull workes, that it was his wil that the Hebrues ſhould haue the poſſeſſion of thoſe regions, to whom (as <hi>Dauid</hi> hath wel ſaid) both the earth and the fulneſſe thereof belongeth. Neither could the <hi>Chananites</hi> murmure agaynſt the iudgement of God, for as much as they were iuſtly cut of from their ryght, for their ſundry and manifold wicked Actes.

The firſt is, that he which betrayeth be by a certain faith aſſured that the cauſe is iuſt which he aduaunceth: whiche can not be done, excepte that he haue ſure proofe of the goodneſſe therof by the word of God.

Furthermore it is very neceſſary that a man be not dryuen to that but then when all other kynde of remedyes wante. For <hi>Rahab</hi> ſo did: for except ſhe had then ſo kept the Hebrew ſpyes, they had bene by mans reaſon vndone, neither was there then any other waye to ſaue them. And certainly it oftentymes chaunceth, that all other ways &amp; meanes being tryed, the worſe parte will not be brought to ſoberneſſe, ſo that there is no other remedy, but onely by prodition. And I would therefore haue theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diligently obſerued, bycauſe that men are to muche prone to proditions, and that ſuch as are both filthy and wicked. Wherfore we muſt take hede that by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of good men they flatter not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues as though they were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.<note place="margin">The fourth caution.</note> Moreouer <hi>Paul</hi> hath admoniſhed vs not only to auoyde that which is euill it ſelfe, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhew therof.

                     <note place="margin">To the ſecond.</note> that prodition was farre worſer than beſiegyng, bycauſe thys namely beſiegyng is done by ennemyes, but the other by friendes.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:46"/> of <hi>Appianus,</hi> is ſo to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that either of the things compared together be euill.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:52"/> And in lyke ſorte dyd the Apoſtles, when they were ſent by Chriſt, to go abroad among the Ethnikes. Neyther dyd <hi>Paul</hi> diſdayne when he came to Athens, to vewe the temples of the Idols, and there curiouſly &amp; ſubtilly to loke vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and inſcriptions of the altares, wherby he learned that inſcription <hi>Ignoto Deo,</hi> that is, To the vnknowen god, and therof he tooke matter to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermon there, that he might after a ſort reproue the men of Athens out of there owne proper tables.

                  </p>
                  <p>But let vs go forward, and declare what is to be iudged of the weake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men. They, although they are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to pollute themſelues with Idolatrous cuſtomes, yet ought they not to dwell together with Infidels. For being vnlearned, they haue no pretence of teaching. For if they ſhould go about to enſtruct others,<note place="margin">The ignorance of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as touching fayth is to bee repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> they ſhould by their vnſkilfulneſſe eaſly cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true doctrine of Chriſt to be had in deriſion. And ſurely the ignoraunce of ſuch men is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be reproued: foraſmuche as among Chriſtians, there is none ſo very an Ideot founde, but that he is bounde to be able to rendre a reaſon of his fayth and in a ſorte able to enſtructe ſtraungers. And certaynely all men moughte quickely do that, if they would ſuffer themſelues to be inſtructed euen meanely in the Cathechiſme. Neuertheleſſe ſuch as are infected with thys ignoraunce ought to ſeperate themſelues from hauyng familiar fellowſhip with Infidelles as much as nede of the body and ineuitable neceſſities will ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſaye of Scholemaiſters? they are oftentymes enemyes to pietye which yet are appoynted to teach good artes and Philoſophye.<note place="margin">We maye not haue to do with vngodly ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters.</note> I ſay that it is daungerous to vſe them, for as muche as they doe inſtille oftentymes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe thynges into the myndes of the hearers, and when as the Schollers are wonte to haue a meruelous opinion of a learned Scholemaſter it eaſely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward commenth to paſſe,<note place="margin">Godly ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely aduance re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion.</note> that they beginne to reuerence them, and that excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Wherfore when they ſee that they are eloquente and very well learned both in the liberall artes, and alſo in Philoſophy, they can ſcarce perſuade them ſelues, that thoſe Scholemaſters can erre or myſerablye be deceaued in the true religion.<note place="margin">Origene.</note> For on the contrarye part we ſee that <hi>Origene</hi> the <hi>Adamantiue,</hi> being beſydes the religion of Chriſt, wherin he was inſtructed, wonderfully indued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with good artes and Philoſophy, dyd in teaching diſciplines of the Ethnikes bring very many of hys hearers to Chriſt.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> We know alſo that <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he willingly gaue eare vnto <hi>Ambroſe</hi> for hys eloquence ſake, was turned from a Manichite to a Catholyke. So, yea and that more eaſlye (for as muche as we are more prone to euill then to good) it may oftentymes happen that they which are weake and vnlearned in religion, may as touching vngodlyneſſe very much increaſe vnder vngodly Scholemaiſters. And vndoubtedly by thys meanes fell <hi>Iulianus</hi> the Apoſtata from Chriſt, in takyng <hi>Libanius, Iamblicus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> to be hys Scholemaiſters. Wherfore for as much as ſuche Scholemaiſters can not be had without greate daunger, my iudgement is that we ſhould altogether leaue them.</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle in his fyrſt Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> hath not written theſe cautions or exceptions of the weake and vnlearned ones, when as he plainly writeth: If any that is an infidel ſhal cal you, &amp; ye wil go, &amp;c. By theſe words he ſemeth to teſtifye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al that is referred to our wil. Wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtle did not permit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be free to euery wil, but to a wil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ryghtly &amp; wel inſtructed. For if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould go to theſe feaſtes, to be dronke to pamper his belly or gorge, or to ſolace himſelf w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> filthy talke without doubt he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18396:52"/> can not be excuſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Paule,</hi> but is earneſtly to be reproued, for his vnhoneſt wil and wicked purpoſe.

And if he ſhould go, he ſhould not directe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he doth, to to glory of god (as he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.) Furthermore although <hi>Paule</hi> hath not in the ſame place by expreſſe wordes put thys caution alledged, yet it followeth not therby, that the ſame is not to be added: foraſmuch as it is both by firme reaſon manifeſt, &amp; alſo proued by other places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that is in no caſe lawful.

But more ouer thys is required, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we attempt the ſame with an vprighte, perfecte &amp; whole mynde. Wherfore euery one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is vnlearned &amp; weake, ought to ſeparate himſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fellowſhip or familiaritie of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnfaythfull, as much as naturall &amp; ciuile neceſſity ſuffreth. For ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he perceaueth that therby will come ſome danger to his ſoule, he can not with a good minde &amp; ſound counſel be conuerſaunt with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit he may do ſuch duties vnto them as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in the law of God, leaſt he be made guiltye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſentence of <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſayth: whoſoeuer hath not a care of hys, &amp; eſpecially of hys houſhold, he hath denyed the fayth, &amp; is worſe than an Infidell. Yea and the ſame Apoſtle hath commaunded, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of neceſſitye ſhould obey their Maiſters.</p>

                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in a maner intreating the ſelf ſame argument ſayth in the 56. Homely vpon Iohn: If we cut of a rotten membre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, leaſt it ſhould corrupt the other partes of the body, which vndoubtedly we do not, bycauſe we deſpyſe that member. For who at any tyme hated hys owne fleſhe? How much more ſhould we do the ſame in thoſe which are wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyned vnto vs, not that we ſhould deſpyſe them, but that we ſhould prouide that our ſaluation be not there indaungered, where we ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can nothing at al profite them. Wherfore in thys caſe, it is muche vnprofitable to deſire, or to ſeke for familiaritie or concord. To this alſo doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of Chriſt tend which he gaue in the 18. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which are in a manner paſt hope of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; wil not heare their brethren iuſtly admoniſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea and alſo deſpiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyce of the church correcting them, let them be counted as Ethnikes and publicanes.

For when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that our men do liue ſo familiarly with them, they thinke that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and idolatries, wherwith they are infected are not ſo euill, and ſo much to be deteſted. And peraduentur they are brought to this poynte, that in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryng in them, they diſtruſt not but that they may attayne to ſaluation. For vnleſſe it were ſo, they could not perſuade them ſelues, that our men would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it. Beſides thoſe things, there are very many of our men, whiche by the example of this mingled conuerſation do thinke that they alſo may do the ſame, which they ſe others to do. Wherby by the dede or exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of certain, euill ſhould ſpreade abrode more amply, and our fayth and godlyneſſe ſhould be had in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Ethnikes and Papiſtes. And that oftentymes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, which we know to haue happened in the tyme of <hi>Paul</hi> (as it is written in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) that they which otherwiſe were faithful, by this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation do communicate with wicked and polluted rites. For by ouermuch fami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liarity with the Infidels, is by littell and littell made a ſteppe to followe theyr ſuperſtition and Idolatry. Wherefore not without a cauſe did the Apoſtle crye: Flye from Idolatry. I will not ſpeake alſo, how that it is not poſſible, but that, where our men whiche are weake &amp; without learning and knowledge, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with infidels, ſometymes there may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome talke of religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in althoughe they ſlippe not, yet when they can not ouerthrowe the Sophiſtical and crafty argumentes of their aduerſaries, brawling and ſtrife ſometymes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they fall into hatred, curſing &amp; reproches, which haue no edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather hinder it, ſo farre is it of to get a ſteppe to ſet forwarde. To this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> hath written in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial?</hi> what part hath the faithfull with the vnfaithfull? or what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth the temple of God with Idoles? Theſe things are ſo manifeſt, that they nede not the light of interpretation: neither ought they to be vnderſtand onely for contracting of matrimonyes, when as they extend farre and ouer all, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne alſo vnto all kinde of conuerſation with the vngodly, whiche we haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them for our owne cauſe. I know that the ſhadowes of the olde law are now by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefite of Chriſt remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Howbeit, it is not to be doubted but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things abide, of which the people of God was by them at that time admoniſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What was meante by the hemmes of the Hebrues.</note>Wherfore I demaunde, what God ment, when he commaunded the Iewes, to ſowe hemmes to their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes which they ware? Vndoubtedly this he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they beyng taught by that ſigne, might vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ſeuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ethnikes, and that it was not lawfull for them to ioyne them ſelues with them, but as muche as neceſſitie ſhould compell. God oftentymes forbad them that they ſhould not returne into Egypt, and that they ſhould not ſeke ayde of ſtraunge nations. For he would haue cut of from his people all occaſions of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and Idolatry, yea and the place, whiche we are now in hande with, teſtifieth that the Iſraelites grieuouſly ſinned, bycauſe they had brought theſe Idolatrous nations vnder tribute, and had made a league with them, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led together in the ſame cities &amp; fieldes with them. And aſſuredly to what euill it torned them vnto, the hiſtory it ſelfe declareth: for they brought not the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites</hi> to the true worſhippyng of God, but they them ſelues rather forſakyng their God, became lyke Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeake not, how that the conuerſation betwene the Hebrues and Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes was ſo odious euen to the tyme of Chriſt, that the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> (of whom Iohn mencioneth) ſayd vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> that the Iewes were not wonte to be familiar with the Samaritanes. Moreouer it is not mete for Chriſtians, to take away from them ſelues the boldeneſſe and liberty, frely to ſpeake of Chriſt. Whiche they muſt nedes do, if they dwell among infidels. For if they dwellyng with infidels ſhould familiarly haue free talke of Chriſt, either ſhould they be laughed to ſcorne, or elles they ſhould not be ſuffred. Vndoubtedly the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the old tyme, were both grieued and alſo mourned, when by any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie they were compelled to dwell from the people of God. <hi>Dauid</hi> therof is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who ſighed when he was by reaſon of the vniuſt violence of <hi>Saul</hi> conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lyue in deſerte places. And it appeareth in the Pſalmes, how grieuouſly he complayned and lamented that he was forced to dwell among ſtraungers, &amp; ſuch as were farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god. <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; his fellowes mought haue had the fruition of the kinges table, and of moſt delicate meates, and yet they abiected thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities &amp; pleaſures, leſt they ſhould defyle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with the delicate meates of the Ethnikes, and with the vncleane bankettes of the vnbeleuers. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo (as it is written in the xi. to the Hebrues) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he mought haue ben counted the ſonne of the daughter of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and therby haue attayned to great honor, he contemned all this, and went vnto his brethren, which were oppreſſed with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſeruitude, in making bricke and tyles. They whiche followe not theſe examples, do manifeſtly declare, that they haue ſmall mynde of the glorye of God, and that they will not redeme the ſame with their own loſſe or bindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, thoughe it wer neuer ſo ſmal or littel. Do we (ſayth <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corrnth.</hi> 1.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke God? Are we ſtronger than he?

                  <p>Now let vs come to thoſe, whiche do ſo dwell among infidels that they are compelled to be preſent at their vnlawfull rites, whether thoſe be learned or vnlearned, whether they be ſtrong or weake, what they be, in this caſe, it maketh
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18396:54"/> no matter: For I comprehend them altogether. I ſay that none of them, ſuch an habitation or coniunction is to be ſuffred: but either they muſt flye from thence, or rather ſuffre death, than to commit Idolatry. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd (as I haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) Flye from Idolatry. The lawe and Prophetes, the olde and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are full of ordinaunces, commaundementes, lawes, admonitions, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, wherby ſtraunge worſhipping is forbidden.<note place="margin">Daniel. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Daniels</hi> fellowes choſe rather to be caſt into the fornace, than they would worſhip the ymage ſet vp by a moſte mighty king. <hi>Machabea</hi> the mother with her children would rather dye,<note place="margin">Machab. 7.</note> than ſhe would againſt the lawes of God eate ſwynes fleſhe. I could reckon an infinite numbre of Martyrs, which moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly ſuffred death, rather than they would forſake theyr godlyneſſe, which they had profeſſed, hauing this ſayeng alwayes before their eyes, feare not them whiche can kill the body &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> affirmeth the ſame, bycauſe we are the temple of God, the members of Chriſt, and partakers of the table of the Lord, which table can haue nothyng common with the table of deuils.</p>
                  <p>All theſe thinges are to be applied vnto our tymes, when in the tyme of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie godly men, if they dwell with the vngodly are compelled to be at their Maſſes and moſt filthy ſeruices: whiche of all thinges is not lawful vnto them. But ſome take theſe probations by me now alledged to be vnderſtand of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices done to Idoles, and not of the ſuperſtitions, whiche are now vſed in the tyme of Papiſtry.<note place="margin">An outwarde worke can not be counted for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſhipping of God, excepte it be grounded by hys worde.</note> But they ought to remember that no outward worke is to be had for the true worſhipping of God, vnleſſe it be appoynted by the worde of God: whiche if it be not, it can be nothing els but an inuention of man. For we can not without faith worſhip God: and fayth can haue no place, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God is withdrawen. Wherfore in humane actions, how goodly in ſhewe ſo euer they be, vnleſſe god by his word do allow them, they can be no worſhipping of him. Surely if we would honor men, we are wont chiefly to marke,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> in what things thoſe men do delite in: and when we haue found that out, we thinke we haue beſtowed our labour well, when we haue ſhewed vnto them thoſe thinges wherin they were wont to reioyce and delyte. Why then do we not after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſorte with God, to ſerue him with that kynd of worſhipping whiche he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his oracles? Let vs heare him in <hi>Eſay,</hi> how that in the oblations, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, incenſes, and offringes which were brought into the temple without faith, he was rather weryed than reioyſed in them. He abhorreth and deteſteth theſe kyndes of ſacrifices as the Prophetes haue taught vs. Yf theſe thinges are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thoſe ſacrifices whiche they by the word of God vſed, &amp; that for that cauſe only, bycauſe they were offred without faith: what thinke we is to be iudged of the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions of men, &amp; fayned worſhippinges, which beyng voyde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be done with faith?<note place="margin">There is no true god which delighteth in fayned wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppynges.</note> we may verely ſay that they pertayne vnto Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. And that may be manifeſtly gathered hereby, bycauſe there is no true God whiche wil be worſhipped with theſe thinges. Wherfore it followeth that the vngodly whileſt they adioyne ſuch rites vnto their holy ſeruices, they do not worſhip the true God, but him whom they haue fayned with them ſelues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte in theſe thinges. And for as much as in the whole nature of thinges there is no ſuch, they worſhip the Idole of their owne mynde, and therfore iuſtly and worthely they may be called Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay that thoſe thinges which are ſayd &amp; done in the Maſſe,<note place="margin">We muſt haue no regarde to the begynning of Ceremonies but whether they agre with the worde of God.</note> had their beginning by the inſtitution of Chriſt, althoughe they were afterward vitiated thoroughe mens defaulte. That helpeth them nothing, for as much as in theſe thinges we may not haue a regarde or conſideration to their begynning but to their nature and forme. And we muſt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly marke whether they agree with the worde of God. The braſen Serpent by the commaundement of God had his beginning, it was alſo endewed with miracles,<note place="margin">The braſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent.</note> for the Iſraelites were by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon it deliuered from their venemous byting. The ſame Serpent neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:55"/> when the Iewes worſhipped him, and offered incenſe vnto it, the godly men deteſted it. So that the moſt holy king <hi>Ezechias</hi> brake him in pieces, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall vtterly put away the worſhipping therof. We muſt not therfore haue a regard to the originall of a thing,<note place="margin">What the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues meante whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues the golden calfe.</note> but we muſt looke how it is vſed, whether it agree with the firſt inſtitution. The Hebrues when they compelled <hi>Aaron,</hi> to make them a calfe to worſhip, had not that mynde to fall from the true GOD, when as they confeſſed that he brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This was onely their entent, to worſhip him vnder ſome ſigne or viſible forme, and they choſe that forme wherby they had ſene the Egiptians expreſſe their God by.<note place="margin">The maner of of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ethnikes in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</note> So the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nikes teſtified that they worſhipped one God, as the chief author of all thinges, which they faſhioned vnto them ſelues by dyuers and manifold ſhapes. For by <hi>Pallas</hi> they ſay was ſignified his wiſedome: by <hi>Mars</hi> his power and myght. By <hi>Iupiter</hi> his iuſtice and goodneſſe. Wherfore rites and ceremonyes are not to be eſtemed by the counſell and will of men. No otherwiſe muſt we thinke to haue happened of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nabat.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The counſel of Ieroboam.</note> For he would not (as he pretended) plucke away the people from worſhipping of the true God, but bycauſe he was affeard of his kingdome, and ſawe that it might eaſely happen, that if his men ſhould often go vnto the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they would fall from him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the familie of <hi>Dauid.</hi> He ſayd therfore, that to worſhip the true God, they neded neither the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nor yet the arke of the couenaunt. For that God <hi>Iehouah,</hi> as he was ſignified vnto the <hi>Iewes</hi> by the wodden arke and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſo alſo might he be expreſſed vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites by ſignes of gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calues, ſo that that worſhipping which they ſhould performe at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they might commodiouſly celebrate vnto <hi>Iehouah</hi> in <hi>Bethel</hi> &amp; in <hi>Dan.</hi> This man therfore went about no other thing but made an outward worke, whiche he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded as a worſhipping of GOD, and that vtterly without his worde, whiche wanting, all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was done was mere ſuperſtition and Idolatry. Tyrannes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and princes, when they compell men to polluted rites, although they ſay they do them for a good intente (as they terme it) and how ſoeuer they pretend ſome certain beginning of au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, are not yet to be heard. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner admoniſh the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Communicate not with their vnfruiteful workes, but reproue them.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:56"/> that is true in dede, that an other mans ſynne is imputed to no man, but yet whileſt ye are preſent at prophane rites, that is blamed in you, and iuſtely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto you, in that you communicate with an other mans vngodlyneſſe. The Apoſtle in hys firſte Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſayde: do ye not knowe that they whiche do eate of the ſacrifice, are made alſo partakers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? What ſaye I than? That the Image is any thyng? or that it whiche is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto Images is any thyng? Nay. But this I ſay: that the thyngs which the Gentiles offre, they offre vnto deuilles. But I woulde not that you ſhoulde be partakers of deuilles, ye can not drynke of the Cup of the Lorde, and of the Cup of the deuilles, ye can not be partakers of the Lordes table, and of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of deuilles. &amp;c. Wherefore, thoughe the corruption of the Sacrifices is not to be imputed to the communicantes, yet for all that the communicatyng it ſelfe, from whiche they ought to haue kepte them ſelues, maketh them blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. And vnleſſe the thyng were ſo, why would not the holy Martyrs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the rites of the Ethnikes? why did <hi>Paul</hi> ſo reproue the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians?</hi> But here they returne agayne to this, to ſaye, That the Maſſe is not to be compared with the Idolatrye of the Ethnikes. For (ſaye they) thoughe it ſomewhat ſtraye from the inſtitution of Chriſte,<note place="margin">The Maſſe hath nothyng common with the inſtitution of the Lord.</note> yet ought it not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a prophane and an Idolatrous thyng. But I affirme it to be ſo muche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, that almoſt it nothyng at all agreeth with the inſtitution of Chriſt, yea it is moſt vtterly contrarye vnto it. Whiche is very eaſye for me to declare.</p>
                  <p>Firſte the Supper of the Lorde, as it was inſtituted by Chriſte, was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or publique worke:<note place="margin">A contrarietye betwen the ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per of the Lord &amp; the Maſſe.</note> but nowe commeth forth the ſacrificer adorned with monſtrous garmentes, and doth all thynges alone, the reſt ſtand by &amp; onely ſee and heare. Wherefore if <hi>Paul</hi> did iuſtly and worthily rebuke the Corinthians, which taryed not one for an other, &amp; ſayd that they could not eate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: how can they worthily call the Papiſticall Maſſe, by the name of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lorde, whereas onely one ſacrificer eateth and drinketh? Vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by no meanes. Wherefore let them rather call it by any other name, than the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore they ſaye, that they do there offre the ſonne of GOD vnto the eternall Father. And that is by expreſſe wordes denyed in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues. For it teacheth that all thynges were fyniſhed by the onely one oblation of Chriſte. Whiche beyng perfect, we maye not renewe the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. They wyll offre vp Chriſt euery daye. The worde of GOD affirmeth, that it was to be offred but once. I confeſſe in dede, that the Fathers (as I haue before ſayde) did ſometymes in ſuche ſorte ſpeake as thoughe the body and bloude of Chriſte were either offred or ſacrificed in the celebration of the Sacramentes.<note place="margin">How in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt is offred vnto God.</note> But they very oftentymes interpreted them ſelues, that thoſe oblations or Sacrifices, were onely thankes geuyng, or a memory and figure of that oblation and ſacrifice, which Chriſt dyeng vpon the croſſe made.</p>
                  <p>They affirme alſo, that the bread and wyne, are chaunged into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the bodye and bloud of Chriſte, when as the holy Scripture doth teache vs farre otherwyſe. Moreouer they lyftyng vp the bread and wyne, do ſet forth to the people creatures to be worſhypped in ſteade of GOD. For what is more filthy, than religiouſly to worſhyppe a piece of bread, and a Cup of wyne? It is true in dede, that they are made partakers of the bodye and bloude of the Lorde, namely in hearte and mynde, whiche eate and drinke the ſignes of thankes geuyng, with ſyncere fayth, &amp; as the Lorde hath inſtituted. But yf a man do onely beholde and worſhyppe them, then are they nothyng vnto him, but a piece of breade and a Cup of wyne.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer the miniſters of the Churche, when as their duety is to go about all that in them lyeth to lift vp the myndes of the people vnto heauen, that they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18396:56"/> mought not ſeke Chriſt in the world, nor looke for any carnall or earthly thing in the ſupper of the Lord, they miſerably holde the people geuyng head to the viſible ſignes. The Apoſtle in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> commaunded that they ſhould not vſe a ſtraunge tongue in holy aſſemblyes, bycauſe euery one muſt aunſwere Amen. And bycauſe aboue all thinges the edifieng of the hearers is to be ſought for. But in the Maſſe all thinges are done in the Latine tongue. And thoſe wordes whiche ſhould be to the great comfort of the ſtanders by, when as to them the participation of the body &amp; bloud of the Lord is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thoſe wordes do they ſpeake ſoftely, yea they mumble them vp ſo darkelye, that though a man vnderſtande the Latine, yet can he not vnderſtande thoſe wordes. They do for this cauſe ſo ſoftely mumble them vp, as thoughe the members of Chriſt were not worthy to heare them:<note place="margin">The Greke Churche.</note> when as neuertheleſſe the Lord hym ſelfe ſpake them openly, and the Greke Churche, euen to thys daye pronounceth them with a moſte loude voyce. Yea and in the olde tyme, it was a cuſtome vſed (as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> among other do teſtifye) that at thoſe wordes the people aunſwered <hi>Amen.</hi> But as I thinke,<note place="margin">Ambroſe. Auguſtine.</note> theſe men do therefore mumble vp thoſe wordes, bycauſe they are affeard leſt their lyes ſhoulde be founde out. For there they ſaye, Take ye and eate: and alſo,<note place="margin">The Papiſtes in the Maſſe make many Lyes.</note> As often as ye ſhall do theſe thynges, ye ſhall do them in remembraunce of me. When as neuertheleſſe they haue appoynted to eate and drinke it alone. And vndoubtedly very many other thynges ſpeake they ſecretly and openly in the Maſſe, as thoughe many did communicate or ſhould communicate, when as the ſacrificer alone doth it in dede. A lye is euer fylthy, but then moſt filthy of all, when it is admitted in holy thinges, and before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſaye of their applications? They affirme that they can as they luſte them ſelues applye the ſacrifices whiche they make vnto the quicke and the dead.<note place="margin">Euery man is iuſtified by his owne faith and lyueth &amp; dyeth in hys owne righteouſneſſe.</note> But the Scripture teacheth that euery man is iuſtifyed by hys owne fayth, and that all men ſhall either dye or lyue in their owne ryghteouſneſſe or vnryghteouſneſſe: but they ſaye otherwyſe, for they can as they ſaye, helpe both the quicke and the dead by their Maſſes. If they woulde attribute that vnto prayers, namely that they taught that by prayers they mought helpe the neceſſityes of others, it myght be borne with all.<note place="margin">By praiers we he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pe other.</note> But when they affirme, that the worke it ſelfe, namely of the Maſſe, hath in it ſo muche power and vertue, that it can helpe all kynde of men, that maye by no meanes be ſuffred. Beſides this Maſſes are very oftentymes celebrated in the honour of certayne Sainctes: whiche vndoubtedly is moſte farre from the truthe: for as muche as Chriſte hath for thys purpoſe inſtituted hys Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that it ſhoulde be a memorie of hys death, and not of other Saynctes. I will not ſpeake howe that it is moſte commonly ſene, that there is nothyng founde certaine of thoſe Sainctes whome they there worſhyppe:<note place="margin">The lyues of many ſainctes are Apochripha and full of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> the lyues of them are Apochripha, and very often alſo full of fables, and Poetes faynenyngs.

                     </note> if they ſhoulde be demaunded what they meant, they coulde not aunſwere. Wherefore either they aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were nothyng, or if they go aboute to ſaye any thyng, they bryng forth not one thyng, but thyngs moſte diſagreyng: whereby thou mayſte eaſely gather that there is no truth in their wordes. Wherefore fayth can haue no place in theſe thinges whiche they do in theyr Maſſe, when as it onely there hath place, where the worde of God offreth it ſelfe vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>And that they can not defend them ſelues from the deteſtable ſynne of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:57"/> the ymages do teſtifye,<note place="margin">Images are worſhipped in the maſſe.</note> vnto the whiche they turnyng them ſelues do cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their moſt vnpure ſeruices. For they can not be content in the Maſſes to looke vpon them, but they cenſe them, and kneele before them, and finally they do vnto them all kynde of worſhippyng, whiche is to be done onely to God. And bycauſe (as I haue before mencioned) they dare affirme that the Maſſe hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie (I can not tell what) with the inſtitution of Chriſt: it ſhall not be from the purpoſe,<note place="margin">Sacrifices of the Ethnikes are more agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices appointed by God, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe with the holy ſupper</note> and it is eaſy to be done, to declare, that (if we marke the tokens) the olde Ethnikes may with much more likelyhode excuſe and defend their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, than theſe can defend the Maſſes. For the ſacrifices of the gentiles did not differ from the maner of ſacrificyng whiche the fathers had before the lawe, and whiche God allowed in his lawe, when as theſe men in their Maſſe differ from that ſupper whiche Chriſt preſcribed, and as the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſtes and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> haue deliuered. There on euery ſyde was inuocation of God, a temple, an alter, Sacrifices, Prieſtes, Killing, ſheding of Bloud, Salte, Wyne, Oyle, Meale, a holy banket, religious garmentes, waſhynges, fumigations, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fyer, ſinging, oracles and ſuch lyke, whiche would be to long to rehearſe. Let the Popiſhe ſacrificers ſhewe as many thinges, if they can, in their Maſſe, whiche do agree with thoſe thinges whiche Chriſt did in the ſupper. But if ſo be they can not, let them then thinke that their Maſſe doth no more agree with the godly celebration of the holy Supper, than do the rites of the Idolatrers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the legall ſacrifices. Wherfore let them ceaſe of ſo to kyſſe their littel daughter, and to preache that it ought to be counted the inſtitution of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles. I will not ſpeake of the yearely Obites, and Funerals of the dead whiche are oftentymes vſed there, of whiche thinges the Lord hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commaunded. By it they ſtabliſhe Purgatory, wherof the holy ſcriptures write nothyng. That furthermore is moſt farre from pietie, bycauſe in their Maſſe they poure out prayers vnto ſainctes, whiche are already departed out of this lyfe.<note place="margin">In hearyng of Maſſes the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger of God is not pacified, but prouoked.</note> Finally all the thynges whiche they there do, they make a market of them, ſell, bargayne and ſet them out to moſt filthy gayne.

                  <p>That vndoubtedly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ment when he ſaid: The Scribes &amp; Phariſeis ſit

For as much as prudence is not feareful, neither vntemperate, nor yet vniuſt. Wherefore it hath al the other vertues with it. And againe Iuſtice, Strength, Temperance and the other vertues, ar not without wiſdome, and therfore they are al had being knit together. Theſe thinges (ſaith he) agree not with the holye ſcriptures. For there it is written: In manye thinges we al offende. And if we ſay we haue no ſynne, we deceaue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing we ſynne in many things, we can not in ſynning haue vertue which is oppoſite vnto ſinne which we commit.<note place="margin">Ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes he whiche ſlideth in one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante in an other.</note> And neuertheleſſe it often chaunceth that hee whiche falleth in one thing, maye be conſtant in other thinges.

For they take deliberation, and with knowledge they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine rather to loſe their goodes than their life. And as they in that worke do wiſely, ſo do our men for the loue of lyfe and body, &amp; couetouſnes of the goodes of this world, vnwiſely chooſe the loſſe of eternall life, when as with a wycked diſſimulation they go vnto deteſtable Maſſes. Wherefore the excuſe which they bring, cannot be receaued as iuſt. The <hi>Corrinthians</hi> alſo mought by this reaſon when they were reproued of <hi>Paule,</hi> haue defended them ſelues.

Chriſt was alledged who was conuerſaunt with Phariſeys, Synners, and Publicanes. But he was not onely ſtrong and wyſe, but alſo the chiefe of all wyſe and ſtrong men, and he could ſo profit the euyll, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of others could nothing at al hurt him.

                  <p>Secondly was brought foorth a place of <hi>Paule,</hi> who prohibited, that a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full huſband or wyfe ſhould not departe from an Infidell,<note place="margin">To the ſecond.

As touching this purpoſe of <hi>Paule,</hi> we muſt diligently marke, fyrſt that he ſawe ryght well, that the neceſſities of lyfe could not ſuffer, that all thoſe which bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18396:63"/> not at that time in Chriſt, ſhoulde be auoyded: for the greateſt parte of men at the beginning were farre from Chriſt, neyther coulde the infideles haue bene made better, if our men had ſeperated themſelues altogether from them.</p>
                  <p>But by the ſentence of <hi>Paule</hi> the corrupte brethren were driuen both to griefe and ſhame, whileſt they ſawe that for their ſinnes they were eſchewed of thoſe, to whom before they had bene familiar and deere, and were ioyned vnto them as members of one body.

Secondly bicauſe he was of ſo greate conſtancye and wiſedome that he coulde be conuerſaunte with the vngodly withoute any hurte to hymſelfe, and to theyr greate profite. For whether ſo euer he went, he caried aboute with him the name of God and the worſhipping of him.<note place="margin">To the fyfth.

And when afterwarde thoſe places were by the power of God burnte, he was compelled whether he would or no, to remoue from thence. I neede not to ſpeake muche at thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sirian,</hi> for I haue before entreated inoughe of hym.

                  <p>Now reſteth ſomewhat to ſpeake peculiarly of Iewes and Heretikes.<note place="margin">Of the Iewes.</note> For theſe kynde of men are ſuffred almoſt in all cities, prouinces and kyngdomes to dwel together with Chriſtians.

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> among other bringeth forth certayne reaſons. He in his .iiii. and .xviii. bookes <hi>de ciuitate Dei,</hi> and alſo vppon the .lviii.

Blindneſſe (ſayeth <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Romanes</hi>) fell partly on Iſrael: as though he woulde ſay, not on al. Moreouer the ſame Apoſtle addeth, when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is entred, then all Iſraell ſhall be ſaued. And leaſt thou ſhouldeſt peraduenture thinke, that theſe wordes are to bee vnderſtand allegorically, <hi>Paule</hi> writeth them as a miſerye, and to confyrme his ſentence he bryngeth the Prophecye of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet: namely that iniquitie ſhal be then taken away from <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore they are now called enemyes vnto God, for our ſakes: but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led frends, bycauſe of their fathers.

For it is written, that he departed into a farre countrey, bycauſe the Ethnikes were ſo farre departed from God, that they openly worſhipped Idoles, and with open profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>But the elder ſonne, by whome was ſhadowed the people of the Hebrewes, went not ſo farre. And although he were not in hys Fathers houſe, whiche is the Churche, he dwelled for all that in the fielde. For the Iewes are exerciſed in the holy Scriptures whiche they doe not ryghtlye vnderſtande, nor yet
<pb facs="tcp:18396:64"/> with that ſpirituall ſenſe wherein the Churche of Chriſte taketh them, but in an earthlye and carnall ſenſe. Wherefore they are not vnaptelye ſayde to bee in the fielde.

But if thou wilt contend y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were afterward faultes brought in by them, then will I ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought chiefly to haue corrupted thoſe places which do teſtifye of Chriſt and his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and which were alledged by the Lord himſelf, and of the Apoſtles in the newe Teſtament. But they remaine vncorrupt, and the ſame ſentence remaineth ſtil in the Hebrue Bibles which they put. For they wer not ſo carefull for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words. Wherfore it is not likely that they as touching other places haue corrupted the holy ſcriptures. Yea if a man diligently reade ouer their bookes, he ſhall finde in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18396:64"/> them a great many more teſtimonyes and thoſe more plaine and manifeſt, than our common traſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath. Do not they read in the ſecond Pſalme: Kyſſe ye the ſonne, which ours haue tranſlated, Take ye hold of diſcipline? Which woordes vndoubtedly are referred vnto Chriſt.

But the opinions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreing with the holy ſcriptures ſerue for the matter. Pride and couetouſneſſe make hereſie.

By this definition it is manifeſte inough (as I thynke) who be heretikes, I minde not at this preſente to ſpeake of the kindes &amp; ſortes of hereſies.

                  <p>But before we come to entreate of the oration of this legate, it were good to declare what he was. The Hebrew worde <hi>Melach,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is doubtful what this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate was.</note> and alſo the Greke worde <gap reason="foreign">

There are examples of theſe in many places of the ſcriptures, which ſhould be ſuperfluous now to declare. Some ſuppoſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome certayne ſpirite was ſent from God, whiche appeared vnto the people in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forme, and reproued them as he was commaunded: And they perſuade them ſelues that he was firſt ſene in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and there commaunded the people, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from thence to a place, whiche was afterward called <hi>Bochim</hi> of weapyng. The Hebrew word <hi>Melach</hi> is not agaynſt this interpretation: and that maketh with it alſo, bycauſe he ſpeaketh as God.<note place="margin">The aungell ſpeaketh in the perſon of God.</note> 
                     <hi>I haue made you</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>to aſcend out of Egypt.</hi> With whiche ſelfe ſame kinde of ſpeache the Aungell in <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in <hi>Exodus</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Where it is alſo written, that God put his name in him.

For it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Iohn,</hi> No man hath ſene God at any tyme: the ſonne which in the boſome of the father he hath declared him. Theſe wordes declare vnto vs that what ſoeuer thinges are ſayd to haue ben ſpoken by God in the olde Teſtament, the ſame were made open by Chriſt. But other ſuppoſe that this meſſanger or legate was a miniſter of the Churche, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is either a Prieſt or a Prophet, whoſe office was, to reprehend the ſinnes of the people.

                     <hi>Leui</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth therfore thinke this to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely, bycauſe it is not conuenient, that an aungell ſhould openly ſpeake to ſo great a multitude.

The counte of the yeares if they

Vndoubtedly hereof followe woundes almoſt thoroughe out al the partes of the body, and new pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and thoſe vehement ſuccede one an other.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:67"/> together with vs, can not be but very full of troubles.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhement whiche God here threateneth, is no new puniſhement, for al that is here written, was foreſpoken in the boke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> the 23. chap.

                  <p>For the Iſraelites had afterward experience of theſe miſeryes, bycauſe they were oftentimes brought into bondage by their enemyes among whom they dwelled, and with whom they had vngodly ioyned them ſelues.

Wherfore Chriſtians ought alſo to do the ſame, but yet in thoſe landes, cities and houſes whiche they poſſeſſe, namely they muſt there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe Idoles and ſuperſtitious altars. Howbeit it is not lawfull for them to breake into other mens houſes landes and Townes, and with violence to breake and ouerthrowe Idoles and altares. This (ſayeth he) is not to heale the ſynne of Idolatrye, whiche lyeth chiefly in the hearte, it ought chiefly be weyed out of the heartes of our neighbours, by the worde and doctrine, whiche beyng done, as many as we ſhall wynne vnto Chriſt, will helpe vs to take awaye out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Images, when as they are perſuaded by the worde of GOD, and that by our diligence, they haue firſt ſhaken away the ſame thinges out of their own heartes.<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſilium Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berinum.</note> And accordyng to this meanyng the Counſell holden at <hi>Eliberium</hi> did decree in the 60.

Wherein we muſt knowe that true and lawfull repentaunce conſiſteth chiefly of two principall poyntes,<note place="margin">Two principal pointes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which do ſpryng out of fayth.</note> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely of a ſorowe conceaued for the wicked Actes committed, and of a ſure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to obtayne pardon by Chriſte.

Secondly fayth embraſeth the promiſe of forgeueneſſe of puniſhementes by Chriſt. And whileſt it is occupyed about theſe two thynges, ſo many outwarde ſignes alſo do follow.<note place="margin">Two outward ſignes followe true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> For of ſorow come ſyghinges &amp; teares, which haue adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſinnes committed, whiche is ſometymes expreſſed, &amp; ſometymes cloſe.

Agayne,<note place="margin">A ſacrifice hath an outwarde part and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part.</note> wee muſt know that this kinde of ſacrifice conſiſteth of two partes, whereof the one is an inward part, namely whereby we freely and without compulſion referre vnto God our own wil and our ſelues wholy, and all that wee haue receaued, and we make them ſubiect vnto him, and conſecrate them vnto his name. The other is an outward part, wherby by ſome gift, and that viſible and ſenſible, we do as it were by ſome token and ſigne, teſtify what we haue in our hart, and we offer vnto him ſomwhat of thoſe things, which he himſelf hath geuen vnto vs. So they in the old time offered firſt fruites, tenthes, and ſacrifices. In whych thinges they dyd not onelye ſhadowe Chriſt,<note place="margin">The outwarde ſacrifice with out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inwarde pleaſeth not god.</note> the moſt acceptable ſacrifice vnto God, but they teſtified alſo, what loue they them ſelues bare vnto God.

                  <p>If thou wilt aſke, what be thoſe outward works,<note place="margin">The outwarde ſacrifices of the Hebrews.</note> wherby we may teſtify the inward ſacrifice?

All theſe latter kinde of ſacrifices are as well common vnto vs, as to the fathers. Theſe thinges we geue vnto god, to beare witnes of our faith, and obeyſaunce towarde hym. And ſeing that it is not to be doubted of thoſe firſt, which wer offred in the time of the law, but that they were in their time ſacrifices, leaſt there ſhould be anye ambiguitye had of the other which wee mencioned in the latter place, whether they ought to be counted in the place of ſacrifices, we wil confirme it by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the ſcriptures. It is written in the .50. pſalme: Offer vnto god the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe. And in the .51. pſalme: A ſacrifice vnto god is a troubled and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hart. &amp;c. In the .12. to the <hi>Romanes:</hi> I deſire you for the mercy of god, that ye would ſet foorth your bodies a liuely ſacrifice, holy. &amp;c. <hi>Micheas</hi> ſaith in the .vi. chap.

                     <note place="margin">Whither the ſelfe ſame thing may be both a ſacrament and a ſacrifice.</note>Here ariſeth a doubt, bicauſe we haue put a difference betwene a ſacrament and a ſacrifice: and yet if the elders in their oblations and ſacrifices had the ſelf ſame thing, that we haue when we celebrate the ſupper of the Lorde, whych no man doubteth but to be a ſacrament: How ſhall that be true that we ſaid before that there is a difference betwene a ſacrifice and a ſacrament, ſeing that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the ſacrifices of the Elders muſt alſo be Sacraments? To this I anſwer that the reaſons of theſe thinges ar diuers, and yet that letteth not but that one thing may be both a Sacrament and a Sacrifice. For no man doubteth but that philoſophy and ſtrength of the body are diuers thinges, which neuertheles may be ſene both in one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: So alſo it happeneth here, that one thing may be both a ſacrifice &amp; a ſacrament,<note place="margin">The ſupper of the lord is both a ſacrament &amp; a ſacrifice.</note> although the reaſon of a ſacrament and a ſacrifice be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.

This ſelf ſame thing may we ſe in the killing of the ſacrifices which wer in the old time done before god: for they wer both ſacraments, wher in Chriſt was geuen to the men in the old time to be receaued of them by faith, &amp; by which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated before the Lord in eating &amp; drinking together.

And yet the ſame wer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſacrifices, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ther thei did both conſecrate theirs &amp; them ſelues vnto god.</p>
                  <p>But to retourne to the hiſtory, when as very many kinde of ſacrifices were commaunded in the law, namely for ſynnes and for faultes, peaceofferings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and burntofferings, it is vncertain which of theſe the Iſraelites vſed at this preſent: for the hiſtory declareth it not. But by as much as maye be coniectured by thoſe thinges which are ſpoken, he ſhould not erre in my iudgement, whiche ſhould affirme that they ſacrificed for ſynne. For to this ende pertaineth both the ſermon that was preached, and alſo the weeping of the people, namelye to haue forgeuenes of their ſynnes, and to retourne againe into fauour with god.</p>
                  <p>But ſome peraduenture wyl maruayle, why they durſt ſacrifice there where
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18396:71"/> the tabernacle of God was not fixed, when as in <hi>Deuter.</hi> it was moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden by a law, that the people ſhould not Sacrifice in anye other place.<note place="margin">Whether it were lawfull to ſacrifice there where the taber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacle of God was not.</note> But as touching that law we muſt vnderſtand, that it was not of efficacye till ſuch time as the Arke and Tabernacle of the Lord had a fixed and firme place.

For it might eaſely be that the ſelfe ſame man which preached the ſermon, offered ſacrifice in the name of the whole people for ſynne, for that he exerciſed the office of prieſthoode. For he ſucceeded <hi>Eleazer</hi> his parent, according to the promiſe of God.</p>

Then muſt they procede to the adminiſtration of the Sacramentes, wher the faithful may be made more aſſured that their ſinnes ar by Chriſt forgeuen them, they may alſo geue thankes vnto God, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſundry praiſes celebrate and cal vpon him.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18396:72"/> bicauſe they wanted force,<note place="margin">God forgeueth ſinnes but he doth not by &amp; by reſtore the good thinges taken away.</note> luckelye to fight againſt thoſe nations. For God, to puniſh the tranſgreſſion and violating of his law, had nowe withdrawen theyr ſtrength and audacity. And although they repented, yet he did not by and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vnto them their old ſtrengthes. For he vſeth in deede ſtraightwaye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue repentaunt ſynners into fauour, but he doth not by and by reſtore thoſe thinges which he by his iuſt iudgement hath for ſinnes taken away. This maye we eaſely ſee in the fal of our firſt Parentes. For the euils therby comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankinde, wer not taken away of God. Yea and thoſe commodities &amp; moſt quiet ſtate, whiche they had in Paradiſe, men neuer afterwarde recouered, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God hath reconciled vnto himſelfe thoſe that beleue in Chriſt. For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> had woord brought him by <hi>Nathan</hi> the prophet, that his ſinne was forgeuen him, yet he could not eſcape, but that his ſonne which was borne vnto him, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and he himſelfe fel into grieuous miſeries. So God woorketh ſomtimes, partly to keepe diſcipline, and partly to make manifeſt vnto men, how much he deteſteth ſinnes. Againe more and more to ſtirre vp repentaunce, and that an earneſt repentaunce of wicked actes committed in ſuche as are renued. But let vs returne vnto the hiſtory, wherin certain thinges, which happened vnder <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua</hi> are more fully repeated.</p>
                  <p>Now (ſaith he) <hi>He had let the people go, and euery man went into his inheritaunce,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſua ſent away the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple twice from hym.</note>

For at that time euery Tribe went to poſſeſſe thoſe places which fel vnto them by lot. <hi>Ioſua</hi> alſo ſent away the people when he ſhould dye. For he had called together vnto him the whole multitude of the Iſraelites, by his laſt ſermon to admoniſh and exhort them. Which he preached in ſuch ſorte, as it is deſcribed in his booke the .24. chap. And as it is moſt likely, we ought to vnderſtande that ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in this place, to be the ſame which was done laſt. Seing that it is written in the place now alledged, that when the people had heard the words of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> &amp; renued the couenante of god, they wer ſent awaye, and euerie one went to his owne poſſeſſion. After that is mencioned the deathe of <hi>Ioſuah</hi> euen with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wordes, as it is now repeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſua when he ſhould dye executed the office of a good prince.</note>Here let vs note, that <hi>Ioſua</hi> being almoſt at the poynt of death executeth the office of a good Prince, in exhorting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people openly, &amp; that with many words, not to depart from the ſincere religion. In which thing he with a godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudy imitated <hi>Moyſes,</hi> whom he ſucceded, who (as we reade toward the end of <hi>Deut.</hi>) behaued himſelfe after the ſawe ſort. <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo the moſt holye Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arche, euen now ready to dye, called vnto him al his children, and ſeriouſly, and with great holines preached vnto them. And that Princes and Kinges ſhoulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly do the ſame, it is preſcribed vnto them in <hi>Deuter.</hi> that they ſhould be moſt ſtudious in the law of God. For by that meanes were they made apt to admoniſh the people, and to exhort them faithfully to obſerue the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Lord. The Iſraelites when they wer ſent away by <hi>Ioſua,</hi> ar ſayd to haue gone to poſſeſſe the land, bicauſe as yet ther remained very many places for euery Tribe not yet conquered. Of which places when <hi>Ioſua</hi> was dead, and in the time of the Elders they obtained certain, when as they got the victories in battailes, as we haue heard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning. After which victories the firſt tranſgreſſion folowed, vnto which ſucceded the repentaunce before mencioned. But they abſtained from idolatry as long as <hi>Ioſua</hi> lyued, and all the time of the Elders, which wer equall with him, and ouerlyued him, who alſo had ſeene the wonderfull workes of the Lord. For at that time ſound doctrine, and the woord of the Lord teſtified by notable victories, wer of great force.</p>
                  <p>That good Magiſtrate by whom the publike wealthe was then gouerned, had had experience of the wonderfull power of the woord of God, and therefore he continually laboured openly to inculcate &amp; vrge it vnto the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:18396:72"/> which thing could not want iuſt fruit. Experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce declareth,<note place="margin">People frame them ſelues to the example of their princes</note> that almoſt in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, the people frame them ſelues to the example of their Magiſtrates. For if the Princes be zelous both of religion and godlines, their ſubiectes alſo wil em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace godlineſſe and religion. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe if Princes liue vngodly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, the people wil likewyſe deſpiſe religion and lyue filthily. Moreouer, let the Magiſtrate as long as he is in authority, chiefly haue a care to thys, that the holy miniſtery be perfect, and that it teache and adminiſter ſound doctrine, and pure rites, and that he ſuffer not ſuperſticious or wycked opinions to bee thruſt into the church. But euen as he prouideth that other Artificers abuſe not their ſciences: ſo let him diligently beware y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Miniſters of the church do not either corrupt the godly rites, or falſify y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy doctrine. We ſee that ſomtimes it happeneth, that the miniſtery in the Church is very laudable and pure.

Wherfore we muſt with moſt feruent praiers deſire, that ſeing the church hath now by the benefit of God in many places recouered godly doctrine and ſincere Miniſters, that it would pleaſe God to geue vnto it Magiſtrates which may be moſt zelous of godlines and religion.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſhould aſke whether the people may be good and godly, although the Magiſtrate and Miniſter of the Church be corrupt. I anſwer, that ſomtyme they may be, as touching ſome: as we ſee to happen in the Papacy, where ſome godly and holy men are euery wher found, which neuertheles lyue vnder wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, corrupt, and vngodly ciuyl Magiſtrates and Miniſters of the church.

But to declare what pretence they made, when they departed from the woorſhipping of the God of their Fathers, and what occaſion they tooke, and alſo to ſet foorth that they were of a corrupt and naughtye nature, which when their good Maiſters and Magiſtrates were dead, became vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all true godlynes. For it is very likely, that they as they were impudent ſo alſo openly they boaſted abroade thoſe or ſuch lyke woordes. We ar in doubt neither do we eaſely beleue that the Lord did ſo many miracles as our Fathers haue both written and alſo ſhewed vs. Who can tell whether they were ſo or no? we vndoubtedlye know not whether the Lorde or anye other God hath for our ſaluation ſake cauſed ſuch or ſo great thinges to be done. And ſo they lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith and forſaking the true God <hi>dyd euyll in the ſyght of the Lorde.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How thinges in the ſcripture ar called good or euell in the ſight of the lord</note> By this hebrewe phraſe it is declared that God was maruellouſlye offended wyth thys their tranſgreſſion. As contrarywiſe they are called good thinges in the ſight of the Lord which doo excedingly pleaſe him. This is the common and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued expoſition.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit if we more narrowly marke this kinde of ſpeeche, we ſhall eaſylye perceaue that it declareth ſome other thing vnto vs. Namely that thoſe thinges which the Iewes dyd, were allowed by mans iudgement, and peraduenture had a goodly ſhew, but yet in Gods iudgement, they were moſt deteſtable. And withoute doubte that people ſynned a great deale more haynouſlye in thys laſt tranſgreſſion, than they did in the firſt. For there they onelye omitted the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of ymages and aultares, but here they woorſhip ſtraunge Gods. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durſt they do this onely, but they forſooke alſo the worſhipping of the true God. Wherein vndoubtedly they were to be counted muche more corrupt than were the <hi>Samaritanes.</hi> For they although they woorſhipped their Idoles, yet therwithall they ioyned the worſhipping of the true God as it is declared in the ſecond booke of Kinges. And in how euyll part God taketh it thus to bee reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he hath expreſſed by <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet in the .2. chapter: Where hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Hebrewes to go and looke vpon other Nations,<note place="margin">An amplifieng of the idolatrye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes</note> and ſee whether they haue ſo vnconſtantly chaunged the Gods of their Fathers. Whiche Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons if they were knowen conſtantlye to haue retayned their old woorſhippings although they were vngodly, <hi>Iſrael</hi> might thereby learne not to abiect their old rites and cuſtomes of their Fathers. This wycked acte moreouer was for thys cauſe much more deteſtable, bicauſe they had newly receaued the benefit of their deliuery out of Egipt, and had alſo made a couenaunt with god, firſt by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and afterward by <hi>Ioſua,</hi> when he was euen at the point of death. Furthermore bicauſe they began to worſhip the gods of thoſe nations, which they had nowe eyther driuen oute of the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> or els made tributaries vnto them ſelues. What a diueliſh madnes was this to count thoſe gods for true goddes, which could not vndoubtedly againſt the Lord, helpe euen thoſe whyche woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhypped them.</p>

But an Idole is (as wee nowe ſpeake of it) euerye fourme or ſhape whyche menne haue inuented vnto them ſelues to ſignifye or expreſſe God.

Wherfore whether they be ſtones, wood, or mettals,<note place="margin">A diuiſion of Idoles by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> by which God is outwardly expreſſed there to be worſhipped, theſe are groſſe and moſt many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Idoles.

And this is an outwarde woorſhipping or adoration.<note place="margin">Outward ſyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are alſo geuen vnto Princes</note> But wee muſt note that ſuche outwarde ſignes of bowing the body or knees, and ſuche other lyke are alſo geuen vnto creatures, to Princes I ſaye and Kinges which doo in earth repreſent vnto men the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, and are his Vicars in the adminiſtration of thinges.

                  <p>But we muſt there take heede, leaſt in our inward iudgement we attribute more vnto them than is meete,<note place="margin">What we muſt beware of whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we geue vnto Princes ſignes of adoration.</note> or looke for greater thinges at theyr handes than their power and might is able to perfourme. Otherwiſe we ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde idolatrye. Wherefore if a man in bowing him ſelfe to his Prince, would teſtifye that his Prince coulde not erre, and that it were lawfull for him to doo any thing, and as he luſt him ſelfe to commaunde whatſoeuer pleaſed him, that man vodoubtedly ſhould be counted an Idolatrer, and ſhould commit the ſame both inwardly and outwardlye.<note place="margin">The Papiſtes commit Idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trye towarde their Pope.</note> And whether the hirelinges of the Pope vſe this, we may hereby eaſely gather, bicauſe they do ſo throw them ſelues downe at his feete, that there teſtify that they wyll be ſubiect vnto him as to the onely Vicar of Chriſt in earth, as to the vniuerſall Biſhoppe of the Church, as to him which cannot erre in decreing doctrine of fayth, and finally, to whom onelye it is lawfull to diſcerne as hee lyſt him ſelfe of religion and Chriſtian diſcipline. Wherefore let this be euery where a ſure and firme rule,<note place="margin">Note a certain ſure rule.</note> that theſe outwarde ſubmiſſions of the body doo then pertayne vnto Idolatry, when as they are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the mynd, attributing more vnto a creature than is mete, or which are onely proper vnto God. For they are not referred vnto God him ſelfe, or to the obedience of his commaundementes, but to vayne formes &amp; ſhewes, which we haue fayned vnto our ſelues, and conceaued in our mynde.</p>
                  <p>Hereby may we alſo gather, that the inuocations of Saintes which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes vſe,<note place="margin">Inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> are Idolatrous.

But they which do cal vpon ſaintes, they beleue that they doo heare them, and that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, which without doubt is to attribute more vnto them than the ſtrength and order of a nature created can ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>But here they trifle and ſay, that they doo not thinke ſo, but that God hym ſelfe which heareth their prayers doth open vnto the Sayntes, what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them. But thus I aunſwer, that they deceaue both them ſelues, and alſo others. For they knowe not whether God wyll ſhewe vnto the Sayntes their vowes or prayers.

                  <p>They bryng alſo a fayned lye of the glaſſe (as they ſay) of the deuine eſſenſe,

Yet ſhoulde they bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to graunte that that theyr glaſſe hath not a naturall repreſentyng but a voluntarye, ſo that there the Sainctes can ſee that onely which GOD will haue ſene: Otherwiſe withoute any exception the Sainctes myghte there ſee all thynges: whiche is both falſe, and alſo moſte manifeſtlye reſiſteth the holy Scriptures. Bycauſe, of that daye (ſayeth the Lorde) neyther doe the Aungelles knowe, whiche yet doe ſee the face of the Father. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the Papiſtes doe not after thys manner call vppon Sainctes: for if they did they ſhoulde ſaye thus, Cauſe O God that thys or that Saincte maye knowe thoſe thinges whiche I deſire of hym, and that he maye bee with me, and graunte me that whiche I deſire. But they doe cleane contrarilye, O Saincte Peter (ſaye they) Sainct Paule pray for me, bryng thys or that to paſſe for me. Wherfore they thinke that the ſaincts do altogether heare &amp; vnderſtand their voyces, whiche thing if they thoughte not, then were their doinges vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly folyſhe.</p>
                  <p>They declare alſo by their titles &amp; additions which they aſcribe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed virgine, to the croſſe, and other creatures,<note place="margin">The Papiſtes attribute more vnto creatures than is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</note> how far more worthy they eſteme and iudge of them, than their nature can ſuffer. Neither are they affeard (as I haue before declared, when I entreated of the hereſyes of the Papiſtes) to lyghte vp lyghtes, Waxe tapers and Lampes vnto creatures, to cenſe them, and to doe other thyngs, which the Ethnikes,<note place="margin">An alter is not to be erected but only vnto God.</note> and alſo the Iewes in the olde law were wont to geue vnto God only. What more? Do they not builde alters vnto Images of Sainctes? But vnto whom alters are builte, the ſame are confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a ſure teſtimonye to be powers of God, or ells Gods. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in hys x. Tome &amp; .vi.

For they, namely the Ethnikes, what GOD they haue, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they take that Image for a god the alter doth teſtifie. What ſhould the alter do there if they counted not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for a god? Let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay vnto me: It is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of god, it is not god. But I haue already ſayd: I would to god they knew this ſo wel as all we know it. But what they count it, or what they make of it, that alter teſtifyeth.</p>
                  <p>But ſay the aduerſaries: we therfore do theſe things,<note place="margin">Of miracles which are done at the alters of ſaintes.</note> bicauſe we haue by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience proued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they pleaſe god: for as much as he there worketh miracles.

But god doeth therefore woorke theſe thinges ſometymes, that the doctrine of the Prophetes and the Apoſtles whiche was the very woorde of god might bee confyrmed. And yet the Scripture declareth not that there was any inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made eyther vnto <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Elizeus</hi> when thoſe miracles were done.

                     <hi>Paule</hi> hath faythfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> But thou wilte ſaye that the deuill can not doe theſe thynges vnleſſe God will and permitte. I graunte that. And why it is hys will ſo, there are two cauſes ſette forthe in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:76"/>
                  <p>Of the which the one is gathered out of <hi>Deutr.</hi> namely bicauſe he would tempt vs, wherby might euidently appeare how much we eſteme his word, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will ſuffer our ſelues to be plucked from him by ſuche illuſions: the ſeconde cauſe is to punyſhe the vnbeleuers. For ſo doth <hi>Paule</hi> teache vs to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> bycauſe (ſayeth he) they haue not receaued the loue of the truth therefore they are deliuered to be deluded with inchantementes and deue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe miracles.</p>
                  <p>But there are two places in the Scriptures whiche are diligentlye to bee weyghed and conſidered, that the doctrine now in hande may bee the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmed. The fyrſte is written in the Actes of the Apoſtles the tenth Chapiter. Of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion,<note place="margin">Cornelius caſte himſelf down at the feete of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> to whom when <hi>Peter</hi> came he caſte himſelfe at his feete. But <hi>Peter</hi> woulde not ſuffer that, yea he reprehended hym, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in thys manner. Doe not ſo, ryſe vp, for I alſo am a man. We read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Apocalipſe,<note place="margin">Iohn fel downe at the feete of the Angell.</note> that Iohn fell downe before the Aungell, but he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed hym that he ſhoulde not ſo doe: I am (ſayeth he) thy fellowe ſeruaunt. Theſe two places maye thus bee vnderſtande, that <hi>Peter</hi> and the Aungell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned theſe actes, as in a manner Idolatrous, as thoughe the Centurion and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhoulde attribute any deuine nature,<note place="margin">Neither Corne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lius nor Iohn would worſhip creatures.</note> the one to <hi>Peter,</hi> the other to the Aungell, and ſhoulde haue geuen vnto them more honoure than was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente for creatures. But it ſeemeth that thys can not be eaſelye thoughte of eyther of theſe. The Scripture teſtifyeth that the Centurion feared and worſhipped God. How ſhould we therefore beleue that he coulde be led, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that <hi>Peter</hi> was God or at the leaſte to attribute deuine honoures vnto a creature? And it is not very likely that <hi>Iohn</hi> whiche was either an Apoſtle or ells a notable deuine (as ſome call hym) coulde not diſcerne an Aungell from God. If ſo bee that neyther of theſe woulde worſhip a creature in ſtead of the Creator, thys remaineth, that it is not lawfull to geue vnto creatures this kind of outward reuerence. Wherfore we ſhall ſeme not to haue ſayd well before, in ſaying that theſe thynges may be geuen vnto Princes and Kinges. To thys I aunſwere, there muſte be a difference obſerued betwene a ciuile and a worlde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye honoure and a deuine and religious woorſhipping, as we haue before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.<note place="margin">The Centurio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Iohn ſinned in exceſſe but they can not be accuſed of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrye.</note> Furthermore we muſte knowe that theſe two men, <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> I ſay and <hi>Iohn</hi> intended not by thys their worſhipping to tranſferre the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God vnto creatures. Howbeit it may eaſely bee, that they fell to an vnmeaſurable ſigne of reuerence, and ſo in that exceſſe they ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſinne.</p>
                  <p>But as touching Kinges and Princes, we are in much leſſe daunger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than toward Angels or miniſters of Chriſt. For theſe bycauſe they exerciſe the ſpiritual office, the honor which is geuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> draweth nighe to a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adoration. Wherfore in thoſe places eyther the bowing of the knee or of the bodye are not by themſelues condemned. But in as muche as they are geuen for Religion ſake. Moderate honoures therefore maye bee geuen eſpecially when they are geuen for Religion ſake. And thus muche at this preſente as concerning thys thyng. But let vs remember that whiche I haue alſo before admonyſhed, that thys alſo belongeth to Idolatrye, when we woorſhip the true God by other wayes and rytes,<note place="margin">They which worſhip God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath inſtituted, are Idolatrers.</note> than he hath willed vs, and preſcribed vnto vs. If we ſhall doe otherwyſe, we ſhall woorſhip an Idole accordyng to that ſeconde forme before deſcribed, in fayning to oure ſelues in oure mynde or harte any God, whiche delighteth in a woorſhippyng inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men: and there is none ſuche. Wherfore we ſhall not honoure and worſhip the true God, but an Idole whiche we haue conceaued in our mynde.</p>
                  <p>And vndoubtedlye ſo oughte we to vnderſtande <hi>Paule,</hi> when he ſayeth to the <hi>Corrinthians</hi> in the fyrſte Epiſtle: we knowe that an Idole is nothyng in the worlde. <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth not that an Idole is nothyng as touchyng the

                  <p>The puniſhment impoſed by God for Idolatry is now ſet forth to be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered by vs. There are two thinges, which are declared.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſt is deſcribed that the anger of God was kindled agaynſt the Iſraelites.<note place="margin">How we ſhuld vnderſtand god to be angry and to repent.</note> Secondly how he puniſhed the guiltye. God therefore bycauſe of ſo grieuous a wicked crime of the Hebrewes waxed hotte agaynſt them: which is not ſo to be vnderſtande, as though God had any affections, for that pertaineth only vnto men. But according to the common and receaued expoſition of theſe places, we fele that god is like vnto men that are angry, after which ſelfe ſame reaſon it is written that he ſometime repenteth. Wherfore, God eyther to repent or to be angry, is nothing ells, but that he doth thoſe thinges, which men repenting and men angrye vſe to do. For the one do eyther alter or ells ouerthrowe that which before they had done: and the other take vengeaunce of iniuries done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his booke of <hi>Noe</hi> and the Arke, the fourth Chapter,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> ſpeaketh other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the anger of God. For neither doth God (ſayth he) thinke as men do, as though ſome contrary ſentence ſhould come vnto him, neither is he angrye, as though he were mutable, but therfore theſe thinges are beleued, to expreſſe the bitterneſſe of our ſinnes, which hath deſerued the wrath of God, and to declare that the faulte hath ſo much and ſo farre encreaſed, that euen God alſo (whiche naturally is not moued eyther by anger, or hatred, or any paſſion) ſemeth to be prouoked vnto wrath, &amp;c. And aptely is there mencion made of the anger, before the puniſhment is rehearſed. For me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe fyrſt to be angry, before they reuenge:<note place="margin">What anger is.</note> Neyther is anger any other thyng ells (if we may beleue <hi>Ariſtotell</hi> in hys Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torikes) but a deſire of reuengement bicauſe of contentempte. For they which perceaue themſelues to be deſpiſed and contemned, do ſtraightway thinke, how they may be reuenged, and they diligently meditate howe by ſome puniſhment they may requite the iniurye or deſpite done vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Two kindes of punyſhments are mencioned in thys place,<note place="margin">Two kynds of puniſhmentes.</note> the taking away of goodes and ſeruitude: of the which the one is grieuouſer than the other. For it is far more grieuous to be brought into bondage, than to be ſpoyled of goods. But God vſeth ſo to do to punyſhe by certayne degrees, thoſe which haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued euill. For he doth not by and by punyſhe moſt greuouſly. And as touching the woordes we muſt note that <hi>Schis</hi> and <hi>Schiſch</hi> ſignifye one thing, for <hi>Shin</hi> and <hi>Samech</hi> haue great affinitie the one with the other, which <hi>D. Kimhi</hi> hath alſo noted in thys place. Moreouer where it is ſayd, <hi>whether ſoeuer they wente oute,</hi> the ſame interpreter addeth, <hi>to fyghte:</hi> And in deede it is very lykely, although I am not ignoraunte that that ſentence may be more largely taken,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> namely to vnderſtande that whatſoeuer they tooke in hande to do, or to what thinges ſo euer they applyed themſelues vnto, all thoſe thynges happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckely vnto them.</p>
                  <p>By this place is gathered, that no mans goodes are taken awaye, neyther are any brought into bondage, excepte God himſelfe both will and alſo bryng to paſſe the ſame. For it is ſayd here that he gaue them into the handes of raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſold them into the handes of their enemyes round aboute them. <hi>Dauid</hi> in hys .xliiii. Pſalme grieuouſly complayneth of this plague, and ſaith that God had ſolde hys withoute any price:<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> which place <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conſideryng, he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that at the fyrſt ſighte it ſemeth abſurde, that any ſhoulde be ſolde, when no price is geuen. But thus he aunſwereth, as touching the enemies, which ſolde the Iſraelites, there was a price geuen by the byers. But as touching God, which was the principall cauſe of the ſelling, he tooke no price. For what could thoſe Idolatrous, violent, and rauenous men, vnto whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes were deliuered to be ſold, geue vnto him? Vndoubtedly they neither bought nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued thoſe commodities with any reward. Or ells we may thynke, that the price of the Hebrewe bondmen, was ſo ſmall and vile, that it was counted for nothyng,<note place="margin">The wicked ſell themſelues to ſinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any price.</note> and ſo by thys figure of ſpeach they were ſayd to be ſold without any price. Wherefore <hi>Eſaye</hi> in hys .lii. Chapter, writeth: Ye are ſolde for nought.</p>
                  <p>And this phraſe ſerueth very well for thoſe, which do binde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſinnes and wickedneſſe, when as therby, they ſhall get no commoditie at all. And how hard this bondage was which the Hebrewes ſerued when they were ſo ſolde by their enemies, it is manifeſtly expreſſed in <hi>Deuteronomye,</hi> for there it is ſayde: Thou ſhalt ſerue thine enemye, whom the Lord ſhall ſend vppon thee, in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in thurſt, and in nakedneſſe, and alſo in al penurye, and he ſhal put an yron yoke vppon thy necke, till he ſhall deſtroye thee. Moreouer by theſe examples we are alſo taughte, what Chriſtians euery where deſerue for their daylye tranſgreſſions and innumerable ſuperſtitions and alſo Idolatrous woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippynges. Neyther is it to bee doubted but that a heape of euelles are at hande excepte Chriſt by fayth deliuer vs from thoſe curſes of the lawe.</p>

                  <p>Agayne let vs note, that the Scripture doth here moſt manifeſtly teſtifye, that God him ſelfe deliuered the Iſraelites into the handes of rauenors, &amp; ſolde them into bondage, for that that thinges were done by hys motion. And this doth <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the Prophete euidentlye ſhewe, where he deſcribeth, how <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad-nezar</hi> ſtandyng in the ende of two wayes, and in a maner determining to directe his hoſt one way, was of God chaunged, and after a ſorte forced to turne
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18396:77"/> his armye agaynſt <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And yet muſt we not vnderſtand theſe thinges ſo,<note place="margin">How god may be ſayde to worke euyll workes in the wicked.</note> as thoughe we ſhould thinke that God doth inſtille a new malice into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heartes of the wicked. For they nede it not. For of what ſorte ſoeuer they be, they are framed of malice and ſynnes, but GOD, ſeyng he is a ſtrength and workyng of moſt efficacy, driueth them as he doth all other thyngs to be moued &amp; to worke. Wherfore they whiche are altogether corrupte, and voyde, and deſtitute of the grace and fauour of God, can do nothyng but onely worke euill. But God,<note place="margin">God vſeth the ſinnes of the wicked.</note> by whoſe motion they are ſtirred vp to worke, directeth their euill doynges, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſpoylinges, luſtes and tyrannies, to what end ſo euer it ſhall ſeme good to his iuſtice and moſt highe prouidence. Moreouer let vs here conſider,<note place="margin">It is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to haue God angrye.</note> how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched a thing it is for a man to haue God angry. Wherfore let vs moſt diligently take hede, that in all our affayres that we take in hande, we firſt of all reconcile him vnto vs, by an vpright faith in Chriſt: for he beyng angry &amp; agaynſt vs, nothyng can proſperouſly go forward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe thynges did the Lorde as he had ſpoken and ſworne.</hi> Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges are ſet forth here and there in the lawe of GOD and eſpecially in <hi>Deut.</hi> But we neuer read (that I can tell of) that an othe was in that place ioyned with the threatnyngs. Howbeit we muſt beleue,<note place="margin">Whether an othe be ioyned to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges put in the ſcriptures.</note> that God when he made lawes did ſomtymes alſo adde to an othe. For the Scripture in this place teſtifieth vnto vs that he ſware, whiche is ſufficient, thoughe it be not found in any other place. Moreouer let vs call to memory, that the latter cauſes,<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes are not to be ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the firſt cauſe.</note> whiche commonly are called the ſecond cauſes are much to be conſidered in the ſucceſſe of thynges, as well proſperous as vnfortunate: but yet we muſt much more haue a regarde vnto the firſt and chiefe cauſe, namely vnto God hym ſelfe. So that then when thynges proſper not with vs, we muſt be angry with our ſelues, bycauſe we are alienated from God. And that this is true, this place manifeſtly proueth. For the Iſraelites were the ſame men which they were before, and their enemyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſame men whiche they were before. Wherfore if the Iewes had had God now as fauorable vnto them as they had before, vndoubtedly they ſhould haue obteyned the ſelfe ſame victoryes. Therfore they ought to aſcribe all that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckyneſſe vnto them ſelues. For vnleſſe god had bene angry with them, for the Idolatry whiche they had committed, they ſhould with as good lucke haue ouer comed their enemyes now as they did before. Therfore the Prophetes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they lamented for the miſeries of their people, teſtified that iuſtice, honour, and alſo goodneſſe are to be aſcribed vnto GOD, but confuſion and ignominye vnto them ſelues.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bicauſe</hi> (ſayeth the hiſtorye) <hi>he repented.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto vs by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes whiche we do.</note> What is the receaued expoſition of theſe kindes of ſpeache we haue before declared. But now we muſt marke what this meaneth whiche followeth: <hi>At their ſorowinges.</hi> We may not thincke that God was reconciled or made fauorable vnto them by the ſtrength and dignitye of the worke. For that do men obteyne onely by fayth in our mediatour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> to whiche fayth in theſe and ſuch lyke kynde of ſpeaches we muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually haue a reſpect vnto, therby to loke vpon the roote from whence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruites of true repentaunce, and alſo ſighinges and teares are deriued. Neither do we for all that denye,<note place="margin">God rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth good workes.</note> but that good workes ſpringyng from faith are ſo acceptable vnto GOD, that he rewardeth them with excellent giftes, as well outward, as alſo ſpirituall, whiche commeth of his goodneſſe. So ſayd <hi>Daniel</hi> vnto the kyng of <hi>Babilon:</hi> By almes redeme thy ſinnes. That is, dryue awaye the paynes and puniſhementes, wherewith otherwiſe thou ſhalt be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>But if thou ſhalt demaunde what is to be thought,<note place="margin">Of morall workes done without faith.</note> of thoſe ciuill and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good workes, whiche are done without fayth. I aunſwere, that for ſo much as they procede from a viciate and corrupt nature, they are therfore ſinnes. And for that cauſe they deſerue dampnation and hell fyre. Howbeit God, to the end that the ordre and iuſt diſpoſition of thinges in the worlde might be kept, and to defend aſſemblyes of humane kinde, fellowſhippes and publicque wealthes, cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth that ſuch actions haue many rewardes, not for the worthynes and dignitie of thoſe actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but by reaſon of a certain connexion, wherwith god would theſe thinges to be knitte together. Wherfore it commeth to paſſe, that when as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites do worke outward workes, ſometymes goodly to the ſhew, therby they obtayne notable prayſe. And they whiche are rulers as longe as they honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaue them ſelues, in doyng iuſtice, either in warlike affaires, or elles in honeſt conuerſation (as the <hi>Romanes</hi> in the olde tyme did) may obteyne a moſte large Empyre. For ſo would god haue diſcipline kept, the world and publicque wealthes preſerued. God did therfore repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the ſorrowyngs of the Iſraelites, bycauſe thorough the faith, from whence ſorrowinges and groninges proceded, he was made mercifull and fauorable vnto them.</p>
                  <p>But peraduenture ſome man will doubte, whether god, when he repented,<note place="margin">God doth not ſo repente that he is chaunged</note> were in any poynt chaunged? All the godly confeſſe in a maner with one mouth, that god can by no meanes be chaunged, for as much as that is a certaine ſigne both of imperfection and alſo of inconſtancy. But this variety which here happe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth is not to be aſcribed vnto god, but vnto vs. Of this thing I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſom what before, but this ſemeth to be added at this preſente. If a man will ſay, that god without controuerſy ceaſſed to fauour the <hi>Chananites</hi> agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites, whom he had before ſo ſtrengthened, that he would haue them to oppreſſe the Iewes: and agayne afterward to helpe the Hebrues, whom before he ſemed that
<pb facs="tcp:18396:79"/> hys will was to haue them oppreſſed by the <hi>Chananites.</hi> No man can deny, but that theſe thinges haue variety. How can we therfore defend the will of god fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chaunging?<note place="margin">Variety is the effectes, &amp; not in God.</note> I anſwere, that by the 28. chap: of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> it manifeſtly appeareth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there is a diuerſitie in the effectes, when as for all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god in very dede, continually retayneth the ſelfe ſame will. For it is thus written there in his name: When as I ſhall ſpeake agaynſt a kyngdome or nation, to deſtroye, roote out, and ouer throwe it, if they ſhall repente, I will alſo repente. And contrarywiſe when as I ſhal ſpeake good of a kingdome or nation, to builde and to plant, and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or kingdome ſhall do euill in my ſight, I will then alſo repente me of the good, that I had decreed to beſtowe on them. Theſe wordes declare, that god in theſe kindes of threatninges and promiſes is therfore not chaunged, bycauſe he ſpeaketh not abſolutely &amp; ſimply, but vpon condition. But the accompliſhing or makyng voyde of the conditions, is to be conſidered toward vs. And therfore the chaunge is not to be attributed vnto him, but vnto vs. But if thou ſhalt aſke me, whether god doth before know and decree, what ſhall come to paſſe as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe conditions? I will graunt that he doth. For he euen from without begynnyng doth not only know of thyngs that ſhal come to paſſe, but alſo hath decreed what ſhallbe. But bycauſe the hid priuitye of his will as touching theſe thinges, is not opened vnto vs in the holy Scriptures, therfore ought we to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that rule, whiche (as we haue declared) is pronounced by <hi>Ieremy.</hi> This rule did the <hi>Niniuites</hi> and alſo <hi>Ezechias</hi> the kyng conſider and beholde beyng, not yet ſet forth.<note place="margin">God when he threateneth things whyche come not paſſe, lyeth not.</note> For although deſtruction was threatned them in the name of god, yet for al that by repentaunce and prayers they eſcaped it. Neither is there any cauſe why we ſhould ſuſpect that god doth lye in any thyng, when he ſo threatneth or promiſeth any thinges, whiche afterwarde come not to paſſe. For as touching <hi>Ezechias,</hi> he could no way eſcape death, if we ſhould looke vpon the natural cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, whiche are commonly called the ſecond cauſes. Wherfore the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce beyng pronounced accordyng to thoſe cauſes, he coulde not be accuſed of a lye. And the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> if god had done vnto them, as their ſinnes deſerued, they ſhould vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue periſhed. And god commaunded <hi>Ionas</hi> to preache according to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Furthermore a lye can not be ſo take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in an oration which hath a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or condition ioyned with it, as it may be in abſolute and ſimple ſentences, when as the ſucceſſe depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of the kepyng or violatyng of the condition. More ouer in theſe wordes of the hiſtory is expreſſed the cauſe why the Iſraelites ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and ſighed, namely bycauſe they were oppreſſed and afflicted, and that with thoſe kindes of calamityes whiche are before mencioned, namely bycauſe they were ſpoyled, ſold, and loſyng their liberty and goods, they were no longer able to ſtande before their enemyes.</p>

Wherefore the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the ſame Epiſtle, when he had admoniſhed the Miniſter of the Churche ſo be gentle, ready to teache, pacient to ſuffre euilles,<note place="margin">It is GOD whiche geueth repentaunce &amp; amendement.</note> but ſo for all that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them whiche reſiſte, addeth.

                     <note place="margin">Thre kyndes of leagues.</note> And as the ſame authour writteth in his iiii. booke <hi>de bello Macedonico,</hi> there are thre kyndes of leagues. The firſt kynde is, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the conquerours ſet lawes to thoſe whom they haue conquered, in puniſhyng them and commaundyng them, what they will haue them afterwarde to do. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond kinde is when thinges being yet ſound and neither part ouercome, they commen together, that thynges taken from eche partie may be reſtored and couenauntes of peace may be eſtabliſhed. The thirde kinde is when there is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> warre betwene the parties and certayne princes or cities are ioyned together by ſome couenauntes either to lyue the more peaceably, or elles to take in hande ſome common affaires. And nowe that we haue thus declared theſe thinges let vs ſhewe what a league is.</p>
                  <p>A league is that bonde betwen men, wherby enterchaungeably they teſtifye both by wordes &amp; ſignes,<note place="margin">What a league is.</note> that they are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to performe certayn things, ſo that they handle together with good fayth. And if that it be a bonde, and pertayneth to relation, it is grounded vpon humane actions, &amp; is referred to thoſe thinges whiche the partyes confederated ought to performe the one to the other. It is expreſſed by wordes,<note place="margin">Leagues are expreſſed both by wordes and ſignes.</note> and for the moſt parte ſignes are added. God when after the floud he made a league with mankynd, he did not onely declare the forme of the obligation by wordes, but alſo he put the raynebowe in the cloudes as a witneſſe. And in the league whiche he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> he put the ſigne of circumciſion.

                  </p>
                  <p>A league is deuided into the new league and the olde, whiche deuiſion is not of a generall thing into ſpeciall thinges, but of the ſubiecte into accidences, for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18396:80"/> ſo much as in either league the thing it ſelfe and ſubſtaunce was vtterly one and the ſelfe ſame &amp; onely certain qualities did vary. For the olde league was made with one onely nation of the Iewes, and had certayn additions, the poſſeſſion (I ſay) of the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> the kingdome of the Iewes, and the prieſthode of <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp; alſo the promiſe of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> accordyng to the natiuitie of the fleſhe, and the miniſtery of his owne perſon.

There wer alſo in it miſteries of ſaluation, and promiſes of eternall life althoughe farre more obſcure, than they were afterwarde geuen vnto vs. And contrarywiſe in the new league, there are proprietyes in a manner contrary. For it pertayneth not to any one certayn na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to all nations, how farre ſoeuer the worlde extende. Neither is there any peculiar ciuile adminiſtration adioyned vnto it. Furthermore there are but very fewe ceremonies &amp; outward ſignes (and they very plaine and ſimple) added vnto it.

For as the Lord would then be the God of the Hebrues, ſo now hath he decreed to be the god of the Chriſtians. And that alſo whiche they at that tyme promiſed, namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would beleue in the true god, &amp; obey and worſhyp him as he hath preſcribed, we alſo ought to performe: Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth betwen both parties as a mediatour, and forgeueneſſe of ſinnes, and alſo eternall lyfe is by hym promiſed.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> in the xi. chap: to the <hi>Romanes</hi> hath very wel declared that the league of the elders &amp; ours is all one, when he compareth the Church with the tree, which hath Chriſt as the roote.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils were planted in their place: that is put in the ſame league wherin they were comprehended. The ſame tree he affirmeth to remayne, into whiche ſome are by fayth grafted in, and from the whiche other ſome bycauſe of incredulitie are cut of. Wherfore eche league contayneth both the law and the goſpel.<note place="margin">In either of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are the ſelfe ſame ſacramentes.</note> And there are in either of the Teſtamentes the ſelfe ſame Sacramentes as it is declared in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Cor.</hi> the x. chap: For the fathers were al vnder the cloude, and were baptized in the ſea, and did eate the ſame ſpiritual meate, and dranke of the ſpirituall rocke followyng them, and the rocke was <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Farther we graunt, that as touching outward ſignes, there is ſome variety in their Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and ours, which yet as concerning the things ſignified by the Sacramentes is found to be nothing at al.

Bycauſe the Apoſtle doth moſte warely aunſwere to this obiection, when he ſayeth that euerye lawe doth ſpeake to thoſe men whiche do lyue vnder it. And it is not to be doubted, but that the

Wherefore it is written in the booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he beleued, and it was counted vnto hym for righteouſneſſe. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo teſtifieth that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayde of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he had ſene his day, and therfore reioyſed. The Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> the xiii. chap: affirmeth that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was yeſterdaye, and to daye, and remayneth for euer. Wherfore euen as we are ſayd now to be ſaued, not by workes, but by the true mercy of GOD by fayth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo was it with the fathers at that tyme: For they were iuſtified by no merites, but onely by fayth in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more what obedience ſoeuer the fathers had towarde the commaundementes of God, and alſo fayth in the promiſes, they were not deriued from their owne ſtrengthe and power, but (euen as it alſo happeneth vnto vs) they came vnto them by the grace of God and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

And among other thynges he ſayeth, that GOD woulde geue hys lawes in the heartes and bowelles of men, ſo that none ſhould nede any more to teache hys neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, bycauſe all, from the leaſt to the greateſt ſhould haue the knowledge of GOD. And farther it is ſayde in the perſone of God, I wyll be mercifull vnto their ſynnes, and will no more remember their iniquities, &amp;c. As touching theſe wordes both of <hi>Ieremye,</hi> and alſo of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that thoſe wordes proue not that there is any difference betwene the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentes as touchyng the thyng and ſubſtaunce it ſelfe, but as concernyng the propertyes and qualities, as we haue before ſayde. Neither muſte we thincke that the olde fathers whiche in obeyeng the commaundementes of God, and in right fayth worſhypped hym purely, coulde performe theſe thynges of theyr owne ſtrengthe or naturall powre. For vnleſſe they had had the lawes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God written in their heartes and myndes by the holy Ghoſt, and alſo a will by the grace of God ready to obey hys commaundement they had neuer ben able to haue performed ſuch things. They wanted not therfore the lyght of God which ſhined before them to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beleue. Yea and their ſynnes wer forgeuen them by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Wherfore they alſo had the fruition of thoſe thynges, whiche God promiſed to geue in the newe league. The difference was onely in this thyng as touchyng largeneſſe and perſpicuitye for at that tyme thoſe gyftes were diſtributed to very few,<note place="margin">The error of them which in the olde league acknowledge onely temporal thynges.</note> but now they are euery where communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the gentiles. They were ſomewhat darke at that age, but to vs they are made euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and cleare, ſo that we haue no more nede of the old diſcipline. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it manifeſtly appeareth, howe they erre from the truth, whiche will haue the old league to haue had promiſes onely for poſſeſſing of the lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> and for worldly felicity. And that the people of the <hi>Hebrues</hi> were bounde onely to an outward obſeruation of certayne rites and workes, and not to ſhewe forth good and ryght motions of the minde toward God. The Prophetes declare not the thyng after that ſorte, yea rather they denye that GOD any thyng eſtemeth outwarde workes without inwarde godlyneſſe. And they euery where cry out, that ceremonyes without fayth, and voyde of the feare of GOD are a moſte grieuous burthen and ſo troubleſome that GOD can not ſuffre them. Yea and the lawe it ſelfe maketh mencion expreſſedly of the circumciſion of the hearte: and GOD euery where requireth, that we ſhould heare hys voyce, whiche vndoubtedly is nothyng elles,<note place="margin">God would not fully thoſe chynges that are chaunged.</note> than by fayth to haue to do with hym. Wherefore fayth of the promiſes and commaundementes of GOD, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be counted as the roote and foundation, whiche alwayes abydeth, when as outwarde Sacrifices and viſible rites ſhould at the length be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18396:81"/> Wherfore it is very manifeſt, that god would not haue them for their own ſakes. Howbeit they endured ſo long as men were endewed with a childiſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh to the <hi>Galathians</hi>) whileſt they liued yet vnder tutors, &amp; differed yet very litle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruaunts. But when they receaued a more ful growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpirite, then were the ſacramentes and childyſhe rites (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye. It is manifeſt therefore that the difference betweene the two leagues is not to bee taken of the thing or ſubſtaunce, but of the qualityes and proprieties.</p>
                  <p>Let them therfore ceaſe ſo much to erre, which thinke that god in the old lawe promiſed only earthly thinges, as though at that time he prouided onely for the bodyes and not for the ſoules, as doe Shepeheardes, Plowmen, and Swyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes, whiche haue a care onely for the bodyes and carkaſes of theyr Sheepe, Swine and Oxen, neyther laboure they for any other thyng, but to make thoſe beaſtes ſtrong and fat. We muſt not ſo imagine of God, who ſo made a league with the Elders, that he promiſed them the chiefe felicitie,<note place="margin">God promiſed the old fathers the chiefeſt felicitie.</note> which cheiflye pertayneth vnto the ſoule. Wherefore it is written in the 144 Pſalme. Bleſſed are the people which haue the Lorde for their God. In <hi>Deutronomye</hi> alſo God toke vpon him to bring to paſſe, that they ſhould walke in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements. But what more? Our ſauiour, out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of the old league hath moſt apte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught the reſurrection of the dead. For when the Lorde ſayd that he was the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> and they were then dead, <hi>Chriſt</hi> inferred that they were not dead but that they ſtill liued, and that their bodyes ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, namely in the bleſſed reſurrection. Hitherto pertayneth that that God affirmed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he himſelfe woulde be his rewarde, whiche thyng plainely teacheth vs,<note place="margin">The end of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that in that couenaunte were not promiſed onely carnall and earthly good thyngs. Vndoubtedly it were a great ſhame euen for Kyngs and Princes, whiche being compared with GOD are but fleſhe and bloud, if they ſhoulde bee counted to gouerne the publicque wealthes, onely as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bodyes of the ſubiectes: for as muche as they profeſſe that therefore they prouide for their Citizens outwarde commodityes, quietneſſe and peace namely that they might liue happily and vertuouſlye. Wherefore if Princes ſeeke for goodes of the minde for their Citizens,<note place="margin">The worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of god con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth not only in outward. rites.</note> is it not meete that God hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe prouided farre more noble thinges for the publicque wealthe of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites whiche he faythfully gouerned. Furthermore I do not ſpeake, howe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhe it is to beleue that the old fathers by the league bound themſelues only to outward rites and viſible ceremonies, whereby to worſhip God: when as euen the Ethnikes were not ignoraunt, yea they haue moſt manifeſtly teſtifyed,<note place="margin">Plautus.</note> that the worſhipping of God conſiſteth not in thoſe things. For <hi>Plautus in Rudente</hi> writeth thus: They thinke that they pleaſe God with giftes and ſacrifices: but they loſe both their laboure and coſte. I will not declare thoſe thinges whiche <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Alchibiade</hi> hath written as concerning this thing.<note place="margin">Plato.</note> Yea (as I haue now before taught) the lawe it ſelf and the Prophets declare that the thing was farre otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But now at the length to returne to the woordes of the hiſtorye, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth that the Hebrues had broken their couenant which he had made with their fathers. For they wer departed from the true fayth and inward godlyneſſe Neither ceaſſed they only dulye and rightly to ſacrifice vnto the true God, but they moſt filthily turned aſide to ſtraunge Gods &amp; worſhipping of Idoles. And for theſe things was God angry with them, and eſpecially for this,<note place="margin">The rote of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from god.</note> bicauſe they harkened not vnto his voyce. This vndoubtedly was the roote and the fyrſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of falling, namely not to beleue in god.<note place="margin">The elders made a league with god for their poſteritie.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs here alſo note that the Fathers made a league with GOD not onely for themſelues, but alſo for their poſteritie. As God agayne for hys parte promiſed them, that he woulde bee the GOD not onely of them, but
<pb facs="tcp:18396:82"/> alſo of their ſede and poſteritie.<note place="margin">The elders made a league with God for their poſteritye It was lawfull to circumciſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle ones in the old time, &amp; it is lawfull at thys day to baptiſe them.</note> Wherfore it was lawfull for them to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their children, being yet infantes. And in like manner it is lawfull for vs to baptiſe oure little ones being yet infantes, for as muche as they alſo are comprehended in the league. For they which haue now the thyng it ſelfe, there is nothing can let, but that they may receaue the ſigne. It is manifeſtlye written in the .xxix. Chapiter of <hi>Deutronomye</hi> that the league was made not only with them which were preſent, but alſo with them which were abſent, and not yet borne.</p>
                  <p>But ſome doubte, whyther the poſteritie may be bounde by their Elders. We aunſwere,<note place="margin">Whether they which come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be bound by theyr elders.</note> wee muſte looke whyther the thinges whiche were promiſed by oure Elders were iuſte and honeſte. Then muſte we conſider whyther thoſe promyſes pertayne to ciuill thynges, or to Godlyneſſe. When they are made for ciuill matters, the bonde is ſure, bycauſe it is not lawfull for the poſteritye to infrindge the contractes of their Elders, as are byinges, ſellinges, bargaynes and ſuch like, prouided that they contayne nothyng, that is filthy, vnhoneſt and vniuſte. But if the couenauntes and obligations belong to godlineſſe or to true fayth, the obligation is then ſtrong, for that we are all bounde to true godlineſſe and a perfecte fayth, although there were no league therunto. But if the Elders haue bound themſelues and their poſteritye to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vngodly thinges, it is no bonde. But for God to abaſe himſelfe to make a league with men, it commeth of his mere beneuolence and mercy, wherby we might be more and more ſtirred vp to performe thoſe things which we ought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to do of dutye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I alſo will not caſte them oute.</hi> When he ſayeth, that he will not hence forth caſte oute any one of thoſe Nations, whiche remayned in the Lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> after the time of the death of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> he declareth the puniſhemente, wherewith he woulde nowe punyſhe the Hebrewes. And this muſt we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand condicionally, that is, excepte they repented: or bycauſe God was ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by reaſon of theyr Idolatrye, that he woulde not ſo ſoone caſte forth thoſe Nations, as he would otherwiſe haue done, if they had faythfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their office. And the very woordes of the hiſtorye doe ſtrayghtwaies expreſſe thys latter interpretation. But bycauſe a man myghte doubte why he expelled not the <hi>Chananites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why all the Chananites were not expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the time of Ioſua.</note> while <hi>Ioſua</hi> was yet aliue (who vprightlye behaued hymſelfe towarde God) in this place he aunſwereth vnto it and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he had therefore ſuffered thoſe Nations to remaine, that by them he myght proue the Iſraelites, whyther they woulde woorſhip him purely and ſincerely as their Fathers had done vnder <hi>Ioſua</hi> or not. For as much as I haue at large before ſpoken of this kinde of temptation, I will now ſpeake thereof no more. This onely I ſhall admonyſhe you, that where as there is mencion made in this place of the Fathers, the ſame is to bee vnderſtande onely of thoſe which were good and godlye: otherwiſe euen in the tyme of <hi>Moyſes</hi> there wanted no vngodly ones and rebelles, which fell from the true God. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more we muſt conſidre that theſe thinges were ſpoken, when the Hebrewes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the Iudges tell to vngodlyneſſe. For the thinges which are here mencioned of the fallinges and conuerſions of the Hebrewes whiche followed one after an other, are ſpoken generally and ſummarilie. Otherwiſe God (as we ſhall heare) expelled ſome of the enemyes oute of the lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> vnder euery Iudge. Wherefore in that now he being angrye ſayeth that he will not caſte forth the reſte of the Nations, we muſte vnderſtande it, that he will not ſo quickely doe it, and vnleſſe they tourne agayne vnto the ryghte waye. After which manner <hi>Ieremye</hi> hath taught vs that the threatnynges of God are to be vnderſtand.</p>

For if the enemyes ſhould ſtraightway at the beginnyng haue bene expelled, that people would eaſely haue bene loſte with idleneſſe and ſlouth. Which interpretation if we allow, therby will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followe, that iuſte warres are altogether lawfull.<note place="margin">War is a thing lawfull.</note> For if GOD would teache the Iſraelites the arte of warrefare, then iudged he not that arte vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And to thys purpoſe ſerueth that which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd: Bleſſed be god which teacheth my handes to warre, and my fyngers to battayle. But thys queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whyther it be lawfull to make iuſte warres, is not nowe to be entreated of: for as muche as it is moſt euident, and that by the holy Scriptures, that it is lawfull. And we ſhall haue occaſion in an other place, to ſpeake at large of that matter. Wherfore I will declare what the Hebrewe expoſitours iudge of thys place. <hi>R. Salamon, R. Dauid Kimhi,</hi> and alſo <hi>R. Leui ben Gerſon</hi> write, that God, when he had tempted the Hebrewes and detected theyr vngodlineſſe and Idolatrye, withdrewe from them their ſtrength and ayde. Wherby when they attempted to make warres by their owne power and to fight by their owne ſtrength they learned what it was to make warre.<note place="margin">When God fought for the Iſraelits, they knew not what it was to make warre.</note> Whereas before when God himſelfe fought for them, they were ignoraunt of it. For he endued them with ſtrength, he draue a feare into their enemyes, diſſolued their ſtrength, and gaue the Hebrewes a proſperous ſucceſſe in theyr enterpriſes. One dyd then purſue a thouſand, and two ten thouſand. It is therfore aptlye ſayd that the Iſraelites, when he had not yet broken the league, and god fought for them, were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte of warlyke feates.<note place="margin">How our fyrſte parentes after ſinne knew both good and euell.</note> Euen as the fyrſt parentes of mankinde when they had eaten of the forbidden tree, beganne to know both good and euill. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they were nouriſhed with the grace of GOD, they were touched with the feeling of no euil. And we commonlye ſay of children, when their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes are taken from them, that they ſhall nowe fele what it is to gette theyr own liuyng, which before they had not learned, when they had their parentes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Chriſte alſo vſed the ſame kinde of ſpeche, when he ſayd vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: When I ſent you without bagge or ſcrippe, vndoubtedly you wanted nothyng. But now bicauſe I ſhall be taken from you, let him which hath no ſweard, bye him one: for hereafter the times ſhall be harde and paynefull vnto you, ſo that ye ſhall proue and haue experience of thoſe thinges which hitherto ye haue not felte. And this is the meaning at this preſent, that the Hebrewes were brought of neceſſitye now at the length to knowe and feele,<note place="margin">God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing in the lawe for the learning of the art of warfare.</note> what it was to make warre with enemyes ſtronger than themſelues. They had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of that, before GOD taught them it in taking awaye their ſtrength and ayde. Neither is it founde in the whole lawe that he ordained any thyng for the learning of the arte of warrefare. In <hi>Deutronomye</hi> the xx. Chapiter: he
<pb facs="tcp:18396:83"/> made certaine lawes for making of warre, but they pertayne nothing to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of knowledge in the arte of warrefare. And I, in my iudgemente, doe allowe the interpretation of the Hebrewes, rather than that which was fyrſt aſſigned.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Thre ſynnes of the Hebrues.</note> and contrary to the commaundement of God made thoſe nations tributaries vnto them.

Yea and in the booke of <hi>Eſdras</hi> the laſt chap. we reade of a grieuous complaynt by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iewes in their captiuſtye in <hi>Babilon</hi> had taken ſtraungers to wyues.

And why God would not haue matrimonies ſo contracted, this reaſon is chiefly alledged, bicauſe by ſuch vnlike matrimonies the worſhipping of God is wonderfully empaired. For godly huſbandes or wiues are by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly parties oftentimes alienated from the true god. Neither doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely teache vs this, but alſo experience both in the olde time, and alſo in our time teſtifieth it.

Wherfore he miſerably incurred the wrath of god. The Iewes alſo (as our hiſtorye nowe declareth) had experience of the ſame. And we in our time ſee great hinderaunce to come vnto the beleuers, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe very many of them contract matrimony with Papiſtes. The third ſynne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Hebrewes was, bicauſe they worſhipped Idoles: and that was moſt of all againſt the league which they had long before made with god, for they ſayd: we will ſerue the Lord our god.</p>
                  <p>Further it is added: <hi>And they woorſhipped trees or groues.</hi> Thys woorde <hi>Aſchera</hi> with the Hebrues is a tree, and being in the plural number <hi>Aſcheroth</hi> as it is in this place, it ſignifieth trees, and of ſome it is tranſlated groues.

Wherfore God hath in his hand the affections of our hart, which he loſeth or reſtraineth as ſhal ſeeme good to his moſt wiſe prouidence, &amp; turneth them whitherſoeuer it ſhal pleaſe him. And ſo great is his power,<note place="margin">God worketh more as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinnes than is expreſſed by the worde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. 2. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt beleue that he worketh much more, than may be expreſſed by the woord of permiſſion. For <hi>Paul</hi> feared not thus to write vnto the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> bycauſe they haue not receaued the loue of the truth, therfore ſhal God ſend on them an error, ſo that they ſhal beleue lyes, &amp; al they ſhalbe iudged which haue not bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the truth, but allowed vnrighteouſnes. Theſe wordes manifeſtly teſtifye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God did caſt error vpon them, to puniſh their former ſinne, namelye vpon thoſe which deſpiſed the truth offered them. <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo ſemeth to tend to this, when in the .2. booke of <hi>Samuel</hi> the .16. chap. he ſaid of <hi>Simeck:</hi> Suffer him,<note place="margin">2. Sam: 16.</note> for God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to curſe me. Alſo in the ſame booke the .12. chap. God by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet ſaith of <hi>Dauid</hi> which had grieuouſly fallen:<note place="margin">2. Sam: 12.</note> behold I wyll ſtirre vp euil againſt thee, &amp; wil take thy wiues, &amp; geue them vnto thy neighbour, who ſhal ſleepe with them: this diddeſt thou ſecretly, but I wil do this thing openly, in the eyes of the Sunne and of all Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>If the matter be ſo (thou wilt ſay) they which ſinne ſhall eaſily be excuſed:<note place="margin">The ſinnes of men are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the working of god</note> for they may ſone ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wer by God moued &amp; ſtirred vp to ſin. Not ſo. For me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ar not ſo deliuered by God vnto ſins, as though they wer them ſelues pure &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. For they which ar ſo ſtirred vp to naughtines, haue worthily deſerued the ſame. And the ſame men are not driuen againſt their wil, but they wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delite themſelues in thoſe tranſgreſſions and ſinnes. Wherefore their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is fooliſhe, or rather none.</p>
                  <p>But this ſemeth to be agaynſt the things before ſaid,<note place="margin">Whither God do together both hate &amp; wil ſinnes.</note> bicauſe in the Pſalmes it is wrytten that God is ſuch a one, as willeth no iniquity, and hateth ſynnes. And vndoubtedly he is ſo in dede: For vnles he hated ſinnes, why ſhould he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them? for thinges that are allowed, are not wont to be puniſhed. Farther, he hath moſt ſeuerely prohibited them by his lawes. But as touching this,<note place="margin">A diſtinction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyll of God.</note> thus muſt we decree of the wil of god, that it is in nature and very dede one, whych yet may be deuided for diuers and ſundry reſpectes. For as it is ſet foorth in the ſcriptures &amp; the law, he condemneth ſinnes, he prohibiteth them, and threatneth moſt grieuous puniſhments vnto them. Howbeit bicauſe he directeth the ſame ſinnes whitherſoeuer he wil, &amp; vſeth them to his counſels and decrees, neyther when he may, letteth them, it is therfore ſayd that after a ſort he wylleth them. Neither is it meete to deny that ſuch ſundry reſpectes are in the wyl of god. For god would before al beginninges, haue his ſonne ſacrificed vnto him for a moſt ſwete ſacrifice: who yet himſelf ſaid in the law: Thou ſhalt not kil, &amp; thou ſhalt not ſhed innocent bloud. God alſo forbad, that any ſhoulde be deceaued, who for all that would haue <hi>Achab</hi> to be deceaued of <hi>Sathan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt was kil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led by the will of God.</note> as we haue a lyttle before mencioned. And leaſt any man ſhould doubt that Chriſt was put to death by the wyl of God, we may ſe in the actes of the Apoſtles that it is moſt manifeſtly ſaid that the Iewes did thoſe things which God by his counſel had before ordained.</p>
                  <p>What then? Shal we ſay that god is the cauſe of ſynne? Not ſo,<note place="margin">God if we ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake properli is not the cauſe of ſinne.</note> for if we wil ſpeake properly: and that it may the more manifeſtly appeare, we muſt marke, that one ſelfe acte as it is deriued from vs, is verye ſynne: but in reſpecte that it commeth from God, it is both good, iuſt, and holy. For puniſhment is by God impoſed to wycked men. And to puniſhe ſynnes, no man is ignoraunt but that it partayneth to iuſtice. Wherfore God in withdrawing his grace from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and miniſtring ſome occaſions, which might moue to good things, if they
<pb facs="tcp:18396:86"/> happened to right &amp; iuſt mindes, and which he knoweth the wicked wyll turne to euil, may after a ſort, although not properly, be ſaid to be the cauſe of ſinne. And vndoubtedly that act,<note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>militude.</note> in that it paſſeth through vs, is ſinne, but not as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth from God. For in that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, it is moſt perfect iuſtice. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth ſomtimes, that the ſelf ſame wine being poured into a corrupt veſſell, is loſt, and made paide: which wine as it was brought by the huſbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the veſſel is both ſwete and good. Neither is it hard to vnderſtand how one &amp; the ſelfe ſame act may as touching one, be vicious: &amp; in reſpect of an other, iuſt. For when a murtherer &amp; hangman do kill a man, the act as touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubiect, without doubt is al one, namelye the death of a man. And yet the murtherer doth it moſt vniuſtly, &amp; the hangman by law and iuſtice. <hi>Iob</hi> alſo did wel vnderſtand that when he ſaid: The Lord gaue, &amp; the Lord hath taken away as it hath pleaſed him, ſo is it done. He did not by thoſe wordes praiſe the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Sabines,</hi> &amp; the Deuil, which wer veſſels of iniquity, &amp; moſt vicious: but he with great godlines allowed thoſe euils, as they were gouerned &amp; ruled by the prouidence of God, namely for this cauſe, bicauſe they pleaſed God. It is alſo written in the .2. booke of <hi>Samuel</hi> the .24. chap. of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who vnaduiſedly wold haue the people numbred, &amp; how God was angry with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; therfore he ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp <hi>Dauid</hi> to do that. And in the booke of <hi>Paral.</hi> it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that <hi>Sathan</hi> was the doer of it. For God doth thoſe thinges which he wil haue done by Angels, as wel good as euil. Wherfore that numbring of the people as it proceeded of <hi>Dauid</hi> or the Deuil, was in dede vicious; but in that it came from God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to puniſh the Iſraelites, it pertayned excedingly to the ſetting foorth of hys iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth, that God tempteth none to euyll, but euery one of vs is allured by our own concupiſcence.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Whyther God tempt or no.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wryting of thys thyng in hys booke <hi>de conſenſa Euangeliſtarum,</hi> ſaith that there are two kyndes of temptaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the one of trial, the other of deceite. And in dede as touching tryal he denyeth not but that God tempteth, for that the ſcriptures do confeſſe it. But with that kinde of temptation which deceaueth, whereof <hi>Iames</hi> wrote, he ſayth that God tempteth no man. But the ſcriptures teache not ſo, as we haue declared a litle before of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and before him of <hi>Achab.</hi> Yea, and in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the .14. chap. god ſaith that he had deceaued the Prophet. And the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame maner in other places, as it manifeſtly appeareth in hys bookes <hi>de Praedeſt.

Wherefore God inſtylleth no malice of his, for we haue inough at home. Therefore he cannot bee accuſed, for as much as the beginning of vngodlines &amp; wickednes commeth not from hym,<note place="margin">God when he wyl bringeth to lyght our fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waconeſſe of mynde.</note> but lieth hid in vs. He ought not therefore to bee counted to geue the cauſe and fault, who yet when it ſemeth good vnto him, wil for iuſt cauſes haue our luſts &amp; wickednes brought to light, and rule &amp; gouerne our wicked acts, therby more and more to illuſtrate his iuſtice and glorye, &amp; to aduaunce the ſaluation of the godly. Wherfore his ſingular goodnes and prouidence is very much to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which can ſo iuſtly and wiſely vſe ſo wycked meanes.</p>

And ſeyng that we ar al brought forth of one &amp; the ſelfe ſame lumpe, and that lumpe likewiſe is altogether viciated, it ſhoulde ſeeme that all alſo ought to be of a like diſpoſition and inclination to wickednes. But thys is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be weighed, that beſides thys diſpoſition ther happen naturall mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

And this is not to be forgotten, that none of vs haue ſo in our ſelues the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninges of good actes, which truely pleaſe God, as wee euen from the verye birth haue within vs the beginninges of ſins.

                  <p>Now reſteth to ſee from whence after the ſynne of <hi>Adam,</hi> that frowardnes and corruption came,<note place="margin">Whether the firſt corruption after the ſynne of Adam were deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god or no.</note> and whither it wer deriued from God to puniſh the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked act which was committed. I anſwer, that we maye not ſo thynke: for man was for the fault which he had committed allenated from god, wherfore he iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withrew from him his giftes, fauour and grace. And our nature being left vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to it ſelf, falleth and declineth to woorſe and woorſe, yea it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to nothyng, from whence it was brought forth at the beginning.<note place="margin">Wherefore we muſt ſeke for no other efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe of that corruption.</note> Wherefore by that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of giftes and grace, and departure from God, which is the fountain of al good thinges, nature is by it ſelf throwen headlong into vice and corruption.

                  <p>The hiſtory declareth firſt the ſinne which the Iſraelites committed: then it ſheweth the puniſhment wherwith for the ſame they wer puniſhed. As ſoone as their good Prince was dead, the people fel againe to their olde wyckednes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they onely commit thoſe ſinnes which before they had committed, but to them they added ſome ſinnes more grieuous.<note place="margin">The laſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges wer for the moſt parte more grieuous than the firſt.

Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was bondage, wherin they wer bound &amp; ſerued the <hi>Moabites.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a grieuous kinde of puniſhment: bicauſe it is marueylouſlye agaynſt the ſtate and nature of man.

And bondage, as euen the Lawyers alſo do confeſſe,<note place="margin">Seruitude was brought in by cauſe of ſinne.</note> was brought in by a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law among men agreing to natural reaſon. But it may more truly be ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was brought in bicauſe of ſinne. Enemies when they wer ouercome in warre, wer ſomtimes ſaued, &amp; compelled to ſerue them which ouercame them: and ther can be no iuſt warres taken in hand, vnles it be to reuenge ſome facinorous acte. Wherefore we ſaid wel, that ſeruitude was deriued of ſinne: &amp; is therfore a grieuous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, bicauſe it is againſt the nature of man.<note place="margin">Certaine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections are na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural.</note> I graunt in deede that this is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, for the children to be obedient vnto the parentes, the ſubiect vnto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrates, the vnlearned &amp; vnſkilful vnto the wiſer, &amp; the weake ones muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelues to the mightier. But this kinde of obedience and ſeruice, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward them whych are fauourable vnto vs, and ſeeke for our profyt, is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. Wherefore it very much differeth from the ſeruitude, wherof we now intreate. For that voluntarye kynde of obedience myght haue bene vſed when men were in perfecte ſtate: but thys whyche was brought in for ſynne coulde not bee there. And bondmen are compelled to ſerue not ſuche as are their friendes, but ſtraungers and enemyes, and that in thynges vnprofitable vnto
<pb facs="tcp:18396:87"/> them,<note place="margin">Which is the more greuous bondage.</note> yea and often tymes thynges hurtfull and vnhoneſt.</p>
                  <p>Seruitude alſo is then far more grieuous, when people are ſubiect vnto thoſe enemies which once wer ouercome by them, and whom before they ruled. Theſe euyls happened vnto the Iſraelites.<note place="margin">The Moabits were enemyes to the Iewes from the begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> For the Moabites were enemies vnto the Hebrues, euen from the beginning, and they hired <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe them, and in the wildernes they abandoned their women vnto them, for the which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was afterward grieuouſly plagued. Farther, the Iewes ouercame the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites by warre, and puniſhed them ſore, as we reade in the booke of Numbers. Beſides that, the Moabites wer a filthy and an infamed people: for their father was <hi>Moab,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Loth,</hi> who begat him by inceſt. Nether would God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that they ſhould be admitted into his church. For theſe cauſes therfore, was this bondage moſt hard, and eſpecially vnto the Hebrues, which were alreadye before by god ſet at liberty both from the <hi>Egiptians</hi> and alſo from the <hi>Sirians,</hi> and by wonderfull woorkes from them redeemed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God ſtrengthned Aeglon,</hi> namely in geuing him courage and ſtrength, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him prompt, and ſtyrring him vp alſo by ſome certaine occaſions. <hi>And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vnto hym Ammon and Amalek.</hi> This may be vnderſtand twoo wayes, either that <hi>Eglon</hi> adioyned vnto him ſelfe ſuch confederates, or that god cauſed this league to be made betwene theſe nations. And vndoubtedlye both ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are true: for that which they dyd, they coulde not haue executed without the wyll and ayde of god.</p>
                  <p>Let vs note in this place, that the vngodly, which otherwiſe agree not verye wel among them ſelues,<note place="margin">The vngodly do eaſilye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire agaynſt the people of god.</note> do eaſely conſpire againſt the people of god. Wherfore theſe three nations being ioyned together, did eaſely ouercome the Iſraelites, which wer forſaken of god. <hi>And they poſſeſſed the city of Palme trees,</hi> which is <hi>Iericho,</hi> as it appeareth in <hi>Deut.</hi> and as it is before declared. But in that it is ſaid that they tooke <hi>poſſeſſion of it,</hi> it ſignifieth that they did not ſpoyle it, and leaue it voyde: for they claimed it vnto them ſelues, making the landes and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions therof proper vnto them ſelues. Neither is it vnlykelye, but that they put in it a gariſon of ſoldiors, for to oppreſſe the Hebrues more grieuouſly. And yet I do not thinke, that they reſtored again the city vnto them, for that came to paſſe afterward in the time of <hi>Achab,</hi> as it is declared in the booke of Kynges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Why god pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple by vngodly ones.</note>But this peraduenture may ſeeme maruellous vnto ſome, that god vſed to puniſh his people by other nations farre woorſe than they wer: for as muche as the <hi>Ammonites, Amalekites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> wer Idolatrers, &amp; nations that were ouerwhelmed in all kinde of wickednes. To this I wil anſwer, that it was the prouidence of god, which (as I haue before declared) doth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorte puniſh ſyns with ſynnes, and in ſuch maner chaſten the vngodly, by others that are vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Whi god ſoner puniſheth his owne than he doth ſtrangers.</note> Farther, by it he declareth, that theſe things though they be euyll, yet they can not eſcape, but that ſome way they ſhal ſerue his wil. But whi he differeth to punyſh nations, which otherwiſe are wicked, and his own he ſtraight ways puniſheth, this is the cauſe: bicauſe they pertaining to god, do ſynne againſt his law which they know. Wherfore ther is no cauſe why the Turkes and Papiſts though they ſomtimes preuayle againſt vs, to puniſh our ſinnes, ſhould flatter them ſelues therby,<note place="margin">God wyll not eaſeli ſuffer his worde beynge knowen &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> as though they were much better than we are, or as though their ſuperſticions were better than our religion. For if the <hi>Moabites, Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and <hi>Aſſirians</hi> were not counted better than the Iewes, whom they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came: no more ſhall the Turkes or Papiſtes obtayne the ſame, thoughe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes by the wyl of God they afflict the Goſpellers. Wherfore god doth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh his, for his woord ſake, which is among them publiſhed: hee wyll not eaſely ſuffer, that his woord being receaued and knowen ſhould be deſpiſed and eſcape vnpuniſhed. There were vndoubtedly very many lyers and falſe men at Ieruſalem, and yet god ſuffered them, where as he ſtrayght waye deſtroyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> For he would adorne &amp; ſet forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel &amp; holy miniſtery.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18396:87"/> And now that the Ethnikes do ſee, how ſeuerely God puniſheth vs, they maye eaſelye coniecture what hangeth ouer their heades, according to the ſaying of Chriſt: If this be done in the grene tree, what ſhall be done in the drye tree. And if by reaſon of their blindneſſe they vnderſtand not this, we ought diligently to remember it to our great conſolation. We rede in Ieremye the .xlix. Chapiter that the people of God dranke of the cup of the Lord, which ſemed not ſo muche to deſerue it: Wherfore the Edomites ought much more to loke, to be one day puniſhed with puniſhmentes appointed for them. In <hi>Ezechiel</hi> alſo the .ix. Chap. god exhorteth nations againſt the Hebrues, to kil and ſpare none, but fyrſt they ſhould begyn at his ſanctuary. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo in his .i. Epiſtle the .4. chap. The time is (ſaith he) that iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God. But why he ſayth that nowe is the tyme, I thinke this is the cauſe, bicauſe he ſawe that all thoſe thinges which the Prophetes had foreſpoken of the chaſtiſing of the people of Iſraell before other nations, ſhould chieflye of al take place among the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For thoſe thinges which happened vnto the Iewes in a figure or ſhadowe, do chiefly belong vnto vs. Wherefore Chriſt being made manifeſte, &amp; his fayth being ſpred abroade throughout the worlde, <hi>Peter</hi> thought that it ſhoulde be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoone accompliſhed, that iudgement ſhould beginne at the Chriſtians whiche are the houſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore there are in the fellowſhip of the people of god alwaies ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men ſtill founde, which when ſharpe affliction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth are proued, &amp; as golde in fyer are made more bright, which the heauenly father will chieflye and ſpede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be done. The electe alſo, which haue fallen, being admoniſhed by chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and aduerſities, do vſe to returne againe into the right way. And that the ſame may come to paſſe, God, who loueth them excedingly, doth of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing care prouide. But ſuch as are vncureable, his wil is that they ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be broken, leaſt they might longer than is mete, hurt and with their contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe deſtroy other. Theſe vndoubtedly are the cauſes, why God doth ſooner correcte his own than ſtraungers. It is not to be attributed to hatred but to moſt feruent loue. For the deuine oracles declare vnder the perſon of God. Whom I loue I correct and chaſtiſe.

                     <hi>Ehud</hi> was of a valeant, ſtrong, &amp; noble courage, whereunto was adioyned a ſingular prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Wherfore <hi>Plautus</hi> ſayd, Guiles vnleſſe they be couered by craft, they are no guiles. Thus much as touching the name. Now let vs come to the definition.</p>
                  <p>In the digeſtes <hi>de dolo malo lege.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">The definition of guile. <hi>Seruius.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Seruius</hi> an interpreter of the lawe hath thus defined euil guile, namely to be a ſubtile inuention or deuiſe for to deceaue another by, when as one thing is done and an other thing diſſembled. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therfore is guile, there is deceate by ſome diſſimulation.<note place="margin">Labeo.</note> It is true in dede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Labeo</hi> an interpretor of the law reproued the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which <hi>Seruius</hi> brought and that by two argumentes. Whereof the one is, that ſome may be beguiled without diſſimulation or euill guile. Wherefore the difinition is more ſtrayte and narrowe than that whiche is defined, whiche all men counte to be an error. The other argument is, bycauſe ſome ſometymes by diſſimulation do ſaue and defend their owne, or elles other mens thinges, and yet thereby they beguyle no man, neither do they hurte any man. Wherfore the definition is applyed vnto other thinges beſides that whiche is defined:<note place="margin">An other defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of guile. <hi>Vlpianu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> whiche thing alſo is reproued as a faulte. Wherfore he thus defineth it: Noughty guile, is all craft, diſceate and ſubtility inuented to beguile, delude, and deceaue an other. <hi>Vlpianus</hi> in the ſame place alloweth the opinion of <hi>Labeo.</hi> Sauyng the authoritie of ſuche a man I would ſay that <hi>Labeo</hi> did not well in remouing diſſimulation from the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of deceate. And as touching the firſt argument whiche he hath, I deny, namely that men may be beguiled without diſſimulation, bycauſe vnleſſe they ſhould be together without ſenſe, they would not eaſely, be brought to receaue &amp; to take that which they manifeſtly ſee wilbe hurtefull vnto them. Wherfore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that there be ſome ſhewe and colour added, whiche can by no meanes be done without diſſimulation. Then, where as he ſaith that there are very many, whiche by diſſimulation may defend either their owne thinges or elles thynges of other mens: I graunt that, but yet I affirme that the ſame is guile, although it be good guile, as afterward we ſhal more manifeſtly ſhew. Wherfore as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the definition of guile, it ſemeth that fayning or diſſimulation is alwayes to be added. And for that cauſe the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Seruius</hi> pleaſeth me better, which definition for all that I my ſelfe would rather apply vnto guile in generall, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto euill guile as he did.

That we may not vſe euil guile wyth our frendes, but agaynſt our enemies it is not prohibited, bycauſe it is as it were armor.

                  <p>Howbeit this is to be obſerued,<note place="margin">Who bee the true enemyes.</note> that we ſpeake only of thoſe enemyes which either God him ſelfe, or the publicque wealth, or a iuſt Magiſtrate declareth to be enemyes, and not thoſe whiche euery priuate man hateth. Farther I doubt not, but that ſeyng it is lawfull to repell violence by violence, when there is no other waye to eſcape, it is alſo lawfull to vſe guiles agaynſt guiles. For he whiche repelleth violence by violence, as the lawes do permitte, the ſame man is not to be counted a priuate man, for as muche as he is armed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Wherfore it is manifeſt that he doth not agaynſt the lawe, but with the lawe. So he that is ſodenly oppreſſed, may lawfully eſcape by euill guile if he can.

                  <p>But this is to be taken heede of, that they whiche are ſo deſtroyed by guile,<note place="margin">An acte of the king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke..</note> be very worthy of puniſhment, &amp; as they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called, notorious offenders, &amp; ſuch as can not be puniſhed by an ordinary waye.

But of thys thing we will intreat in an other place. Let them therfore, which defend the Counſayle of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> ceaſe to lay for their pretence, that <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> with a ſafe conſcience could not be let go, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a heinous ſinne in all princes, if they ſuffre heretikes to wandre at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: for bycauſe that which they ſay is ſo farforth true, as they ſhalbe in their power. But when they come by a ſaueconducte geuen them, then are they at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, neither are they ſayd to be in the power of the princes, which call them.</p>

And the verſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> before brought ſerueth aptly for this purpoſe.

                     <hi>Marcus Attilius Regulus</hi> I ſay, knew it.

Neither canſt thou aunſwere me, that he did fooliſhly therin: bycauſe the <hi>Romayne</hi> lawes (as we haue before ſaid) <hi>de captiuis, &amp; poſtliminio reuerſis, in lege poſtliminiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paragrapho Captiuus,</hi> do ordeyne and holyly decree that he ſhould not be counted to enioy the benefite of the law <hi>poſtliminius,</hi> which had promiſed to returne agayn.

                  <p>Wherefore next to God and godlines towarde him, there is nothing whiche ought more to eſteme, then fayth, whiche wonderfully helpeth humane fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

For if couenantes and promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be not kept with thoſe thieues, henceforth they will geue credet to no man that they ſhall take, they would ſende home none to their owne houſe to fetche their raunſome, but as many as they take, either they will kill them, or els kepe them with them in miſerable and perpetuall bondage.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this I thinke good to admoniſhe you of, that in othes let ſignes of vniuerſality trouble no man.

Farther we are hereby taught, that truth is not only to be conſidered as touching one difference of time, but as concerning thre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, for he ſaith, both thoſe thinges which are, and whiche haue ben, &amp; which ſhalbe.

Farther the vertue, wherof we ſpeake, hath chiefly ſimplicitie ioyned vnto it, &amp; it is very much contrary vnto double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Beſides this it is a part of iuſtice. For it re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth vnto things their wordes and to a neighbour the truth which of duty longeth vnto him, without whiche truth humane fellowſhip can not conſiſte. For if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſuſpect him ſelfe to be deceaued by any man, he would neuer beleue him in any thyng.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:18396:94"/> containeth in it ſelfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is leſſe.

                  <p>And as for teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures which do ſtirre vs vp to ſpeake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, I could vndoubtedly bring a great many: but a few ſhal ſuffice. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> x. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements: Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is not only to be obſerued in iudgement, but in all things whiche in our talke we teſtifie to be either true or falſe. Farther, God is ſet before vs of vs to be followed, whom the ſcriptures euery where pronounce to be true. Wherfore we alſo ought to be moſt feruent louers of the truth. And for that cauſe in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> the 18. chap: <hi>Iethro</hi> counſelled <hi>Moiſes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhuld make rulers ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, ſuch men as feared god, ſtrong men, louers of the truth, &amp; which hated couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith alſo: Behold thou haſt loued truth, &amp; therfore thou haſt made me to vnderſtand wiſedome in the inward &amp; ſecret partes of my minde.

                     <hi>Corinth.</hi> the latter Epiſtle he ſaith of himſelfe &amp; of the other Apoſtles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue nothing againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. Yea &amp; the Scribes &amp; Phariſeys beyng ioyned with the <hi>Herodians,</hi> after this ſorte flattered Chriſt, whom they went about to entrappe in his ſpeache.

Hereby they declared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a ſingular vertue for a noble &amp; notable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to preferre the truth before all things. But let theſe teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at this time. Now reſteth to intreat of a lye.<note place="margin">Of a lye. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (who wrot of it to <hi>Coſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius</hi>) affirmeth a lye to be a falſe ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a word. And vndoubtedly all thoſe things which before are declared of truth, we may by the contrarity affirme of this vice. And chiefly it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> affirmed of truth, namely that to be truth, wherby things which are, which haue ben, &amp; which ſhalbe, are ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered. And a lye is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, wherby is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignified which is not: for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe ſpake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. This vice is ſo hurtful, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maketh a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is infected with it,<note place="margin">In equally is the generall worde of a lye.</note> to reioyce &amp; to be glad in falſe thinges. The generall word of truth was equalitie, &amp; of the vice y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall worde ſhalbe inequalitie. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue was very nye ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſimplicity: ſo belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth a lye to doublenes. Truth is a part of iuſtice. But a lye is a part of vniuſtice. By truth humane fellowſhip is kept, but by a lye it is hurte &amp; ouerthrowen.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> But to returne to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who writeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ſayd to lye, which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a wil to deceaue ſpeaketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is falſe, &amp; that to lye is nothing els, than to ſpeake againſt the minde: for liers ſpeake otherwiſe than they haue in their heart. But the deſire to deceaue, is vtterly againſt iuſtice, loue &amp; amitie,<note place="margin">Three thinges ioyned with a lye.</note> which we mutually owe one vnto an other. There are thre things ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in a lye: firſt to ſpeake that which is falſe: ſecondly his will in ſpeaking: and thirdly a deſire to deceaue. The firſt parte longeth to the matter of a lye: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two partes pertayne vnto the forme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A diuiſion of a lye.</note>A lye is deuided into a Seruiceable lye, a Sportfull lye, &amp; a Pernitious lye. And this deuiſion commeth of no other thyng but of the effectes, or of the endes. For this is euermore true, that the endes them ſelues, may haue the nature both of the cauſe and of the effecte. For lyes do either profyte, or delyte, or elles hurte. The ende of a pernitious lye, is to hurte. The ende of a Sportefull lye is to delyte: and the ende of a Seruiſeable lye is to profyte. But <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> bycauſe in vertue he chiefly conſidereth the meane,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> therefore if in ſpeakyng thou
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18396:94"/> excede that meane, he calleth that boaſting: but if thou want of the meane, he nameth it <hi>Irony.</hi> And in that euyl this is chiefly hurtful, bicauſe an euyl or falſe opinion is ingendred in the minde of our neighbour.<note place="margin">A lye is both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll and alſo to be auoyded.</note> For the which cauſe the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſemeth to haue ſayd wel, that a lye is both euyll, and alſo it is to be auoyded. Which thing we may alſo proue by teſtimonies of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For to this belong al thoſe thinges which we before brought to ſtyrre vs vp to ſpeake the truth. And very many places are here and there ſet forth, which deteſt lyes. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: Thou wilt deſtroy al thoſe which ſpeake lyes.<note place="margin">In a lye is an abuſe of ſignes.</note> Ther are reaſons alſo which perſuade vs the ſame: whereof one is, in a lye is an abuſe of ſignes. And for as muche as it is not lawful to abuſe the giftes of God, a lye is vnderſtand alſo to be prohibited. Farther (as it is before ſaid) a lye is contrarye vnto humane fellowſhip, for in lying the conceauinges of the minde ar not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto our brethren, but lyes. Wherfore ſeing man is by nature made vnto fellowſhip, and communication, when he ſpeaketh falſe thinges, he fygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with his own nature. And as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith: Faith is therin hurt,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> for hee which heareth, beleueth thoſe thinges which are ſpoken. Wherfore that fayth, which he geueth vnto other mens woordes, is made fruſtrate. And ſo great a thing cannot be hurt without blame. And laſtly euery man by lying, leeſeth hys own credite: for being taken in a lye, he ſhal euer after be ſuſpected. Wherefore though he would, he ſhall not bee able by admonition or correction to helpe hys neighbour. For the which cauſe the fault which is in a lye, pertaineth not onely to the hurt and loſſe of our neighbour, but it is in it by the general woord, as by that which we haue already ſaid manifeſtly appeareth. But among lies,<note place="margin">What kinde of lye is moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous.</note> that lye ſemeth to be moſt grieuous, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in religion, doctrine, and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, bicauſe in no other thing can guile be more hurtful &amp; pernicious. For there if we ſhal erre, we are thruſt from the eternal felicity.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Wherefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Encheridion</hi> the .18. chap. hath very wel wrytten that they in dede doo ſynne grieuouſly, which deceaue trauelyng men, ſhewing them a contrary waye: but they are much more deteſtable, which as touching godlynes by lying, doo bryng men into errours.</p>
                  <p>If the three kinde of lyes ſhould be compared together, I meane a pernitious lye, a ſportefull lye, and a ſeruiceable lye: A pernitious lye,<note place="margin">Two euyls in a pernitious lie</note> ſhould rightfullye be counted more deteſtable, bicauſe in it are two euyls. One is the abuſe of ſignes: the other is, the hurt of our neighbour. And that both of the minde which decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth (which thing is common vnto all lyes) and alſo of the thing whych is loſt. But as for other lyes, although they are not without fault, yet is that not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diminiſhed by the good added vnto it, either of delectacion, or of helpe. And in dede a ſportefull lye, hath in it but a ſmal and ſclender nature of a lye:<note place="margin">A ſporteful lye.</note> for as much as the falſehood is ſtraightway founde out, neither can it be long hydden from the hearers.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Yea <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wryteth that ſuche lyes are not to be counted for lyes. But as touching a ſeruiceable lye, the iudgement of it is more darke &amp; hard. For ſome deny it to be ſynne: for they ſay it hath a conſideration to thys,<note place="margin">Whyther a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable lye bee ſynne.</note> to helpe our neighbour, whom we ought in woordes and dedes to relieue as much as we can. Wherfore they thinke, that therby commeth no abuſe of ſignes, for as much as al our thinges ought to haue a reſpect to the commodity of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Neither do they thinke that in it is ſinne committed againſt humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, when as by this kinde of lye men are made ſafe, and kept harmleſſe. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſay, that where as it is in the holy ſcriptures written, that God wyll deſtroy al thoſe which ſpeake lyes: the ſame is not to be vnderſtand of euery kind of lye, but onely of a pernicious lye.

But he ſeemeth not to be vtterly excuſed: for although he lied not in calling her ſiſter, yet it ſeemeth that therein he fel, bicauſe in not opening that ſhe was hys wife, he put her in daunger of leeſing her chaſtity. For he left her naked of that ayde, whereby onely ſhe might haue bene defended from comming into ſtraunge loues. Neither is it neceſſary that I ſhould labour vtterly to defende <hi>Abraham:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> For he was a man, and by ouer much feare he might eaſily fall.

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth that there are two kindes of men mencioned in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſcriptures. For hereby it is manifeſt that ſome wer by God made ſo perfect, that although they were not without ſynne, yet we may not raſhly iudge euyl of them, but rather ſee how we may defend thoſe thinges, which in their works haue a ſhew of ſynne. They oftentimes were ſo moued by the holye ghoſt, that God by their wordes and actes would make open certaine ſecretes. Wherefore we muſt beleue that oftentimes they both ſpake and alſo dyd certaine thinges by prophecy. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaide: we wyl returne vnto you, propheſied vnwares, that which ſhould be. For with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in ſafetye he returned from the mountaine. And <hi>Iacob</hi> in ſaying: I am <hi>Eſau</hi> thy ſonne, woulde declare nothyng els, but that hee was the man, to whom the degree, bleſſing and dignitye was due, which thinges ſemed to pertaine vnto <hi>Eſau</hi> that was firſt borne. <hi>Paule</hi> alſo prophecied what ſhould at the length become of the high Prieſt, namelye thys, that he ſhould be deſtroied like a wall that is plucked downe and as a thyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fained and hipocritical. Farther (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) there wer other men not ſo perfect, but wicked, which in the olde Teſtament are mencioned either to haue lyed, or els to haue done ſomthing which ſemeth ſynne. Of thoſe men hee thinketh, we may not ſo labour for to defend a good fame and opinion of them. Of this ſorte of men was <hi>Iehu:</hi> for although that murther pleaſed God, whiche he executed vpon <hi>Achab</hi> and his familye, and alſo his weeding out of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the worſhippers therof, yet for al that he was a wycked king, neyther departed he from the woorſhipping of golden Calues.

But ther is an other kinde of diſſimulation, which tendeth not to deceaue any man, but ſerueth onely to kepe counſels ſecrete that they bee not hindred. And this diſſimulation is not to be repudiated, or to be condemned as a ſyn, foraſmuch (as we haue alredy declared) that it is not alwaies required, that we ſhoulde open what ſoeuer truth wee knowe.<note place="margin">What Chriſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by his diſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mulation.</note> So Chriſte being moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, tooke vpon him the fleſh of ſyn, &amp; hid his innocency &amp; diuine nature.

                  <p>BVt leauing theſe thinges, let vs come vnto the third queſtion, wherof for as much as I haue ſomwhat before ſpoken, I thinke not to ſpeake of it aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in this place, leaſt I ſhould be more ful of wordes than is needeful.</p>
                  <p>Let vs deuide ſubiects, as we haue before deuided them, ſo that ſome of them are mere priuate men, &amp; others are in ſuch ſort inferiors, that the ſuperiour po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in a maner dependeth of them, as among the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> wer the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and at Rome the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the people. Thoſe which onely are ſubiect, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted altogether priuate, ought not to riſe againſt their Princes &amp; Lordes, to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place them of their dignity or degree. The two Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the ſame, namely that ſeruants ſhould obey their Lordes, how rough &amp; hard ſoeuer they be. Farther, the ſword (as it is written to the <hi>Romanes</hi>) is ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen onely to the powers. And they which reſiſt the power, are ſayde to reſiſt the ordinance of god. God would that the Iewes ſhould obey <hi>Nabuchad-nezar,</hi> &amp; he was angry with <hi>Zedechias</hi> the king, bicauſe he fell from hym. Yea, &amp; <hi>Ieremy</hi> by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God admoniſhed and exhorted the people to pray for the health of the king of <hi>Babilon. Dauid</hi> alſo would not ſtretch forth his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt the anointed of the Lord: when he might haue done it with out any difficulty, &amp; to his great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity. The godly ſoldiours of <hi>Iulianus</hi> the <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> obeyed the ſame <hi>Iulianus</hi> in fighting and pitching their campes: nether did they at any time (being alſo armed) rebel againſt that moſt cruel tyran. <hi>Phocas</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſlaine <hi>Mauricius,</hi> poſſeſſed the Empire by great violence &amp; vniuſtice, &amp; wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Gregory,</hi> who obeyed him as his Prince, and gaue vnto him great reuerence.</p>
                  <p>But ther are in publike weales other, which in place &amp; dignity are lower than Princes, &amp; yet in very dede they elect the ſuperior power, &amp; by certaine lawes do gouern the publike wealth, as at this day we ſee in done by the Electors of the Empire, and peraduenture the ſame alſo is done in other kingdomes. To theſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18396:97"/> vndoubtedly (if the Prince performe not his couenants &amp; promiſes) it is lawfull to conſtrain &amp; to bring him into order, &amp; by force to compel him to fulfil the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions &amp; couenants whiche he had promiſed, and that by warre when it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwiſe be done. By this meanes the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſomtimes compelled the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,</hi> whom they themſelues had created, to go out of their offices. The <hi>Danes</hi> in our time did put down their king, &amp; held him long in priſon.<note place="margin">Polidorus. Virgilius.</note> 
                     <hi>Polidorus Virgilius</hi> writeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Engliſhmen ſomtimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled their kings to render accompt of the mony which they had noughtely conſumed. Neither are we ignoraunt that <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the proud,<note place="margin">Of Brutus and Caſſius.</note> was by the <hi>Romanes</hi> for his ouermuch cruelty &amp; arrogan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy put out of his kingdome. I wil not ſpeake of <hi>Brutus</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſſius,</hi> which ſlew <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar:</hi> but whether they did it iuſtly or otherwiſe, moſt graue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vary in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And I in examining their enterpriſe by the rule of the ſcriptures, do not al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low it. Bicauſe they gaue not vnto him the tyranny or Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> but he vſurped it himſelf by violence and power. And God (as <hi>Daniel</hi> teſtifieth) tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth Empires &amp; kingdoms. And although it be lawful to reſiſt tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes which inuade a kingdome, yet when they haue obtayned the Empire, and that they do gouerne, it ſemeth not to belong to priuate men to put them downe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore foraſmuch as the kingdome of the Iewes was ſuche a kingdome, that in it al men depended of the king (for they were not choſen by the noble men, but by ſucceſſion the poſterity of that family gouerned, which God had alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded) &amp; therfore in the lawes in <hi>Deut.</hi> &amp; in the .1. booke of <hi>Sam.</hi> wherein the ryght of a king is conſtituted, ther is no liberty graunted to any to reſiſt them. Yea &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happeneth that ſome of them wer killed. But yet we neuer reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god allowed the murther of them: yea he puniſhed the murtherers. When God at a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny time would trouble the kings of <hi>Iuda:</hi> he did it by the <hi>Babilonians, Aſſirians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Egiptians,</hi> but not the Iewes. He onely armed <hi>Iehu</hi> againſt his Lorde: whyche thing as it was peculiar, ſo alſo muſt not wee take example by it. Hee deſtroyed <hi>Saul</hi> alſo by the handes of the Philiſtians, and not by <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither am I ignorant how manye thinges are decreed of this matter in the Code, &amp; in the digeſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law <hi>Iulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maieſtatis.</hi> But I ſtudieng to be brief do of purpoſe ouerpaſſe theſe things. And although I know right wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Ethniks in the old time appointed rewardes for ſuch as killed Tirannes, yet I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that godlines &amp; the holy ſcriptures do not allow the ſame. Vndoubtedly if it be lawful for the people to put down kings that raigne vniuſtly, no kinges or Princes ſhould at any time be in ſafety. For although they raygne iuſtly and holily, yet they cannot ſatiſfy the people. And ſo much of this queſtion.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18396:98"/> And he addeth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Egiptians vſed in his time to call all kind of oxen of what age ſoeuer they wer, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of calues.

In the meane time he confeſſeth that it is not ſo in the Hebrue, &amp; he hath ſaide truly: for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrue bibles we read <hi>Melamed.</hi> Which woord is deriued of this verbe <hi>Lamad.</hi> And that verbe, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugation <hi>Kal,</hi> is to learn, but in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugation <hi>Pihel,</hi> it is to teach.

And leaſt we ſhould doubt what it is, <hi>Kimhi</hi> writeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a rod or a ſtaffe, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end or top wherof ther is faſtened a prick. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chaldey paraphraſt teſtifieth the ſame, which in ſteede of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word hath put this word <hi>Peraſch:</hi> &amp; that word ſignifieth to prick. Wherfore it is an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whereby oxen in plowing ar pricked. Wherfore the word <hi>Peraſchim</hi> ſignifieth horſmen, of ſpurres, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by horſes are by the riders vpon them, pricked. And thus much by the way.</p>
                  <p>The old writers thinke that in this place is vſed the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> as though <hi>Sangar</hi> did not alone kil ſo great a number of Philiſtians, but that hee wyth other ruſticall men fought agaynſte them, whyche ruſticall men were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with no other kinde of weapons than with goades of Oxen. In deede I know that the holy ſcriptures many times do admit chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of numbers, which whither in this place it be to be receaued, I do very much doubt. Yea (if I ſhould ſpeake the truth as it is) I thinke the contrary: foraſmuch as in this preſent hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory me thinketh no vulgare acte is ſet foorth, but rather a wonder or myracle. But howſoeuer it be, this I thinke is godlily and profitablye to be noted: That any thing may ſerue vs for weapons, when the woord of God is added. A ſlyng and ſtones of a ryuer furniſhed <hi>Dauid</hi> nobly. The iaw bone alſo of an Aſſe was a weapon to <hi>Samſon,</hi> and a naile to <hi>Iahel,</hi> wherwith ſhe ſlew <hi>Siſera.</hi> And contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riwiſe, what kind of weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of fence ſo euer we deuiſe, vnles it be ſtrengthened by the word of God, it ſhalbe vtterly vnprofitable and ſerue to no purpoſe. The walles of <hi>Iericho,</hi> which otherwiſe were wel fenced, fell downe of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:<note place="margin">Pſal. xxxiii.</note> and the great ſword of <hi>Goliah</hi> the Giant was made to cut the throte of hys own maiſter. Wherfore it is moſt truly ſaid in the Pſalmes: A king is not ſaued by much ſtrength, and a horſe is a vayne thing to ſaue a man. But what doo we ſpeake of weapons, when as the ſame happeneth vnto al creatures? For ſo long euery one of them is and abideth, as the woorde of God caryeth and vpholdeth them. For althings whatſoeuer they be, do by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> onely both abide &amp; conſiſt. Yea and the Sacramentes themſelues, taking away the woord of God, are vtterlye nothing. For what do we thinke bread, wyne, or water to haue by themſelues, which may be profitable for our ſaluation,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> or ſerue to ſtirre vp or to ſtrengthen faith? Vndoubtedly nothing. Wherefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath right well ſayde: The word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto the element, &amp; it is made a ſacrament. Wherfore in that .vi. hundred Philiſtians were kylled with an Oxe goade, wee muſt beleue that the ſame came to paſſe by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God, &amp; by the power of his woord.</p>

But leaſt al that ſhould be aſcribed vnto his ſtrength, it is added that God intermedled in the matter, when hee ſolde the Hebrues vnto him, that is, graunted vnto him to vſe them as he thought good hymſelfe, euen to all moſt vile ſeruices, and that as moſt abiect bondſlaues. And this calamity is amplified by many names. Firſt, by the longneſſe of the tyme: for it continued .xx. yeares, when as before <hi>Othoniels</hi> time they were afflicted onely .viii. yeares. And before <hi>Ehud</hi> was ſtirred vp, they ſerued .xviii. yeares. It is declared that this ſeruitude was very cruell, bicauſe <hi>Iabin</hi> oppreſſed the Hebrues by ſtrength and violence. And <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth that it was in ſuch ſort, that they durſt not ſo much as to lift vp their head. And the cauſe of his ſo great crueltye was,<note place="margin">Why Iabin was ſo cruel vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues.</note> bicauſe he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that the Iewes in the time of <hi>Ioſua</hi> had killed his Father or Grandfather. And had ouerthrowen the kingly City <hi>Hazor,</hi> in waſting and burning it wyth ſword and fyre. Farther, the violence and power of his tyranny is by this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in that he had ſo great a number of yron or hooked chariots, and (if we may beleue <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) he went a warfare with three hundred thouſand footemen,<note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> ten thouſand horſemen, and three thouſand chariotes, among which .ix. hundred of them were of yron.

                  <p>Neyther onely this woman was endewed with the ſprite of propheſy:<note place="margin">We comen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes did o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>penly inſtruct the people.</note> for in the holy ſcriptures we reade of other women which were likewiſe inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mary</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Moſes, Hanna</hi> the Mother of <hi>Samuel, Holda</hi> in the time of <hi>Ioſias</hi> the king were Propheteſſes. And in the new teſtament <hi>Marye</hi> the Virgin, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the mother of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> the wife of <hi>Phanuel,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters alſo of <hi>Phillip</hi> the Deacon (as it is written in the Actes of the Apoſtles) were propheteſſes. Neyther do I thinke that we maye denye, that ſome of thoſe weomen endewed with the ſprite of propheſy, did openly teach the people, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarynge thoſe thynges vnto them whiche God had ſhewed vnto them. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the giftes of God are not therfore geuen, that they ſhoulde lye hidden, but to aduaunce the common edifying of the church.</p>
                  <p>And yet hereby it followeth not, that that which God doth by ſome peculiar priuiledge, we ſhould by and by draw it for an example, becauſe according to the rule of the Apoſtle we are bound vnto an ordinary law, whereby both in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corrinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why wemen are commoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to kepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the church.</note> he commaundeth that a woman ſhould kepe ſilence in the church. And he aſſigneth cauſes of this ſilence ſo commaunded, namely becauſe they ought to be ſubiect vnto theyr huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes. But the office of a teacher hath a certayne authority ouer thoſe whiche are taught, which is not to be attributed vnto a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer men. For ſhe was made for the man, whome ſhe ought alwayes to haue a regarde to obey, whiche thing is alſo appoynted her by the ſentence of God, wherby after ſynne commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted he ſayd vnto the woman: Thy luſt ſhal pertayne vnto thy huſband. Farther the Apoſtle geueth an other reaſon, drawne from the fyrſte faute, bicauſe, as he ſayth, <hi>Eua</hi> was ſeduced, and not <hi>Adam,</hi> wherfore if women ſhould ordinarily be admitted vnto the holy miniſtery of the Church, men might eaſely ſuſpecte, that the deuill by his accuſtomed inſtrument would deceaue the people, and for that cauſe they would the leſſe regard the Eccleſiaſticall function, if women ſhould be beleued. It ought therfore to be committed onely to men, &amp; that by ordinary right and the Apoſtles rule. And though God do ſometimes otherwyſe, yet can he not be iuſtly accuſed, foraſmuch as all lawes are in his power. Wherefore if ſometimes he ſend any propheteſſe, and adorne her with heauenly giftes, if the ſame woman ſpeake in the church, vndoubtedly ſhe is to be hearde: but in ſuche ſort, that ſhe forgette not her owne eſtate.<note place="margin">Twoo places of Paule conce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liated.</note> Wherefore theſe two teſtimonies of <hi>Paule</hi> which ſeme to be contrary one to an other, may eaſelye be conciliated. To <hi>Timothe</hi> the fyrſt Epiſtle he writeth, that a woman ought in the church to kepe ſilence: which thinge toward the ende of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> he moſt manifeſtly confirmeth. And in the ſame epiſtle he commaundeth, that a man pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pheſieng or praying ſhould haue his hed vncouered, but a woman when ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth ſhould haue it couered: whereby vndoubtedly he teacheth that it is law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full for a woman both to ſpeak and alſo to propheſy in the church. For he would not haue commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that in this doing ſhe ſhould couer her head, if ſhe ſhould vtterly kepe ſilence in the holy aſſembly. The thinge is in this manner to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that we ſhould vnderſtande the precept of ſilence to be a generall precepte, but the other which is for the couering of the head when they pray or propheſy, pertained onely to thoſe which wer propheteſſes. They vndoubtedly are not for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bidden to propheſy, for the common edification of the church,<note place="margin">Why women propheteſſes were commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to haue theyr heds co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> but to the ende by reaſon of theyr office extraordinarely committed vnto them, they ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get theyr owne eſtate and waxe proude, they are commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to haue their head couered: whereby they myght vnderſtande that yet they haue the power of man aboue them.

                  <p>As touching the miniſtery of the churche, how women may be preferred, &amp; in what ſort they are not apt, we haue before declared.

The Hebrewes thinke that he was <hi>Barak:</hi> but this is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the reaſon why they thinke ſo, bicauſe the ſignification of theſe names haue great affinity one with an other. For <hi>Barac</hi> ſignifieth lightninge, and <hi>Lapidh</hi> is a lampe,<note place="margin">A fained tale the Rabbines.</note> whoſe plurall number is aſwell <hi>Lapidim</hi> as <hi>Lapidoth.</hi> And lampes or torches and lightninges are very lyke.

But that the Rabbines fayned as thoughe God doth neuer beſtowe freely hys grace or giftes. For they ſignify by their fable that ſhe by deſert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a propheteſſe and a iudge, bicauſe her woorkes ſerued for the tabernacle &amp; that very religiouſly.

At the length they deny not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo it was, but they fly to thys, that we muſt haue a reſpect vnto the times, &amp; attribute ſomwhat to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty. For in the primityue church (as they ſay) was there a great wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of miniſters, wherfore they wer fayne to choſe them out of euery ſtate of men, &amp; therfore ther were very many of them which wer maried at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time.

Neither is it mete, that they ſhould diſſemble the neceſſitie of this age, whiche obiecting vnto vs the maner of the old Churche, dare lay againſt vs the neceſſitie therof. There is on either ſide neceſſitie, and therfore if there be a conſideration had of the one let there be alſo a conſideration had of the other.</p>

They baniſhed them alſo ſometimes into a monaſtery to do penance, as it is read in the 34. diſt. chap: <hi>Fraternitatis.</hi> Neither were they content with this cruelty, but the children alſo whiche were by ſuch matrimonies borne, would they haue to be ſeruauntes of that Church, wherin their father had ben, &amp; they depriued them of al their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                  <p>At the laſte, when they haue almoſt no other thyng to bring, they flye vnto theyr vowe as to a holy anchor.

For without doubt it was a great and perillous worke wherunto they wer called, &amp; for as much as they lyued vnder a Tyraunt, their ſouldiers could not by publique authority be muſtered or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, but muſt of neceſſitie by faire meanes be allured, to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Tyraunt.

                  <p>Some man peraduenture will doubte, by what argumentes or reaſons <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac</hi> could be perſuaded, to beleue the wordes of <hi>Deborah.</hi> To whome we aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that he weyghed with hymſelfe, that thoſe thinges whiche <hi>Deborah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, did very well agree with the wordes and promiſes of God. For he, as he had threatened, that the Iſraelites when they ſinned ſhould by his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will be afflicted by outwarde nations: ſo agayne had he promiſed, that he would deliuer them out of the handes of their enemyes, if they faythfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them of their wickednes committed, and faythfully from the heart called vpon him. He promiſed that he would fight for them, neither ſhould their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or feweneſſe in nomber be a let,<note place="margin">The wordes of Deborah were agreable with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures.</note> but that they ſhuld get the victory ouer their enemies. Wherfore for as much as <hi>Deborah</hi> prophecied that thoſe things ſhould come to paſſe, whiche the Lord had promiſed vnto the people of the Hebrues, it was conuenient, that <hi>Barac</hi> ſhould receaue thoſe wordes for true and faythfull</p>
                  <p>Farther the authoritie of the ſpeaker helped thereunto. For <hi>Deborah</hi> was by
<pb facs="tcp:18396:103"/> God conſtituted in the miniſtery, not vndoubtedly by an ordinary prerogatiue, but by a certayn ſingular and principall prerogatiue. And if we ſhould looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Etimology of her name,<note place="margin">Deborah ſigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieth a bee.</note> we ſhall thinke that her orations were verye ſweete. For <hi>Deborah</hi> with the Hebrues is a bee, which beaſt we know is a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent artificer in makyng of hony. And yet all theſe thinges had not ben ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to make <hi>Barac</hi> to beleue her, vnles the power of the holy Ghoſt had perſuaded in his mynde thoſe things which were commaunded. For fayth is onely the worke of the holy Ghoſt, whiche he can worke in the heartes of men without any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtrument, but he hath decreed for the moſt part to vſe them, I meane the worde and the miniſtery, not as though he were bound vnto them, but to ſhew vnto vs, how much we ought to make of theſe two inſtrumentes. Neither do I thinke that it is to be doubted, but that this holy woman, was both by miracles, and alſo by propheſieng of things to come, declared to be the Miniſter of the true God and the moſt healthfull Iudge of the Iſraelites. We therefore ought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to learne, that we muſt altogether heare the Miniſters of God, when they ſet forth vnto vs, his wordes, promiſes, and alſo threatninges out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neither is there any authority in the worlde, whiche ought to be preferred before the miniſtery of the Church and word of God.<note place="margin">They were heard thynges whiche Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> Wherfore iuſtly ought <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac</hi> to beleue the thinges whiche <hi>Deborah</hi> commaunded, althoughe they ſemed both greuous and heard.

                  <p>But I do thinke that <hi>Barac</hi> did ſomewhat doubt: for <hi>Deborah</hi> Prophecied in the name of God that bycauſe of thys aunſwere he ſhould be puniſhed. <hi>And more ouer</hi> (ſayeth ſhe) <hi>thy glory ſhalbe taken awaye from thee, and the Lord will ſel Sy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſara into the hand of a woman.</hi>

For as muche as the lawe of God in Deut. ſo commaundeth and in the 2. booke of kynges it is written, that <hi>Helizeus</hi> the Prophete was in the campe, when the kyng of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> the kyng of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the kyng of <hi>Edom</hi> went to fight agaynſt the kyng of <hi>Moab.</hi> Wherfore Chriſtian princes, when they take any iuſt warres in hande,<note place="margin">The preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Deborah was profitable in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Campe.</note> do ryghtly and orderly if they haue Preachers and Miniſters of the word of God with them in theyr expedition. Farther an other commodity came by the preſence of <hi>Deborah:</hi> for thereby godly men vnderſtoode, that it was no raſhe warre, or taken in hand by humane reaſon, but enterpriſed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, and Counſell of his Propheteſſe.</p>
                  <p>But in that it is written that the glory ſhould be taken from <hi>Barac,</hi> and <hi>Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> deliuered into the hande of a woman, it may be expounded two manner of wayes: either, bycauſe this victory ſhould not nowe be aſcribed vnto <hi>Barac,</hi> but to <hi>Deborah,</hi> namely, bicauſe ſhe ſhould haue the prayſe to haue iudged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to haue ſet them at liberty, and <hi>Barac</hi> ſhould not be counted amonge the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Iudges. Or els bycauſe <hi>Barac</hi> ſhould not kyll <hi>Syſera</hi> with his owne hande, but <hi>Iahell</hi> the wife of the <hi>Kenite</hi> ſhould do it, as it ſhall afterwarde be declared. And in dede this latter interpretacion ſemeth to me more naturall and propre.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe thynges whiche we haue nowe brought forth, are ſome moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted. The firſt is, that God might haue deliuered this people the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites without the helpe or hoſte of ten thouſand men, whom yet he therefore choſed to teach vs, that he diſſaloweth not iuſt warrefarre. Farther that humane helpes, when they are preſent, are not to be deſpiſed. Moreouer he accordyng to his wiſedome vſed the gathering together of theſe ſouldiers thereby to prouoke <hi>Siſera,</hi> that he agayne might gathered an hoſt, and come and ouerthrow <hi>Barac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in that God ſayth he will draw <hi>Siſera</hi> vnto mount <hi>Thabor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The drawyng of God ſerueth both to good thinges and to euill.</note> he teacheth vs, that his drawyng is of force, not onely to good things, but alſo to euill, in reſpect that they are paynes and iuſt puniſhementes. No man can doubte, but that <hi>Siſera</hi> ſinned in this, bycauſe with a great violence he contented to oppreſſe the Iſraelites, and that vniuſtly. And yet GOD promiſed to drawe him to it. Neuertheleſſe we muſt marke,<note place="margin">The maner of the drawing of God is not a like as touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g good thinges and enui.</note> that the maner of the drawing of GOD is not a like as touching good thyngs and euill: bycauſe to good thynges we can not be drawen, execept God do heale our vnderſtandyng, and geue vs a good mynd. For by nature we are the children of wrath and vtterly corrupte, but when we are induced to euill GOD nedeth not to inſtill, any new malice in vs, for as much as we alwayes of our ſelues haue it ready and prompte to do euill: but onely the doyng of GOD, directeth them to what ende he will, and he ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth them, to make open his glory as he hath decreed. After this ſorte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was <hi>Pharao</hi> hardened, and <hi>Siſera</hi> now drawen to deſtruction.<note place="margin">God drew both the men of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac and alſo Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſera but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers meanes.</note> God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drewe thoſe ten thouſandmen after <hi>Barac,</hi> for otherwiſe they would not haue followed him, but this drawyng was after an other maner: for here he vſed the ſpeache of this man, whiche he made to be of efficacy in the heartes of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: but there to moue and prouoke <hi>Siſera</hi> he appointed both falling awaye of <hi>Barac,</hi> and the hoſt gathered by him.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo to be conſidered, that by this place is proued,<note place="margin">Glorye maye lawfully be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred.</note> that glory is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne good thing, whiche iuſte and good men may deſire: otherwiſe <hi>Barac,</hi> to be puniſhed for his incredulitie, ſhuld not haue ben depriued of glory.

Farther we muſt note that God can bryng certayne thynges to paſſe, whiche yet he will not performe, excepte thynges be done of vs. For he could (as it appeareth by thys place) haue geuen the glory of this victorye and health of Iſraell onely vnto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac:</hi> whiche he would not do, bycauſe he refuſed to go alone to that expedicion. <hi>Helizeus</hi> alſo (as it is written in the 2. booke of kyngs) when he was ſore ſicke, and commaunded the kyng of Iſrael which ſtode by him, to ſtrike the earth with and arrowe, and he did ſtrike it onely three tymes, the Prophete was grieuouſly angry with hym, and ſayde: If thou haddeſt ſtriken ſixe or ſeuen tymes, thou ſhouldeſt vtterly haue deſtroyed <hi>Syria.</hi> But nowe thou ſhalte onely thrice vex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is before ſhewed by what meanes <hi>Barac</hi> gathered his men together, namely by an oration of much likelyhood and of muche efficacy whiche was of ſo great ſtrength with theſe tribes,<note place="margin">The counſels of men are ſo efficacy as the predeſtinacion of God hath or deyned.</note> that there came of them ten thouſand men vnto him, neither would God (as it appeareth by the wordes of <hi>Deborah</hi>) haue any more.

Wherefore <hi>Luke</hi> in the Actes of the Apoſtles feared not to write: And they beleued as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were ordeyned to euerlaſtyng lyfe.

And when they ſhould go vp the mounte, thoughe they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18396:104"/> had ben horſemen, they could not haue ben ſo apte in thoſe places.

But fayth ſeeth thoſe thynges which appeare not to the eyes of the body. <hi>Helizeus</hi> the Prophete once prayed, that the eyes of the lad whiche was with hym myght be opened, to ſee the wonderfull number of aungels, whiche very valiantly fought for hym agaynſt hys enemyes.

                  <p>The thynges whiche are nowe by a Parentheſis declared of the <hi>Kenite,</hi> are therefore in the hiſtory by anticipation ſet forth, that thoſe thynges maye the eaſiyer be vnderſtand, which afterward ſhalbe ſpoken of <hi>Siſara</hi> that was killed by <hi>Iahell.</hi>

And in doinge theſe thinges, what inuocation I pray you, what ſacrifices, what thankes geuinge ſhall there be? The true god ſhalbe mingled with <hi>Belial,</hi> idolatrous rites with lawful rites, and true piety with ſuperſtition. Theſe things vndoubtedly diſpleaſe God. For if he would haue thinges after this ſort mingled together, why choſed he a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people vnto himſelf? Vndoubtedlye he did it, that the faythfull mighte liue purely by themſelues, and worſhip the true god ſincerely. And ſeing the matter is ſo, it is not lawful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſedly to haue to do with the vngodly: otherwiſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which god hath appoynted ſhould be troubled.</p>

But they which obiect this example, where find they that theſe men wer idolatrers? I vndoubtedly do not ſee that it can be gathered by the holy ſcriptures. But rather I ſuppoſe that they were worſhippers of the true God. For God ſaide vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would not ſtraightway geue vnto him the lande of the Cananites, bicauſe the ſinnes of that nation were not yet full. Wherfore it is not abſurde to ſaye, that theſe three men were yet there, &amp; did worſhip the true God ſimply.

For he was reproued of God for it. And though it be not expreſſed in the boke of kinges, yet in Paralip: it is manifeſtly deſcribed.

                  <p>I will not tel how often the Iewes were forbidden by the prophets, that they ſhoulde not require helpe of the Egiptians, or of the Aſſirians.</p>

And this ought alſo to he firm, that in lawes, no friendſhips, are ſo honeſt and ſo iuſt, but they are to be broken if God commaund otherwiſe. For al theſe thinges ought ſo long to be of force,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:108"/> as the wil of God ſhal allow them. Wherfore, foraſmuch as God had nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected <hi>Siſera</hi> and the <hi>Chananites,</hi> and would haue them deſtroyed, no couenants could iuſtlye be kept with them. For we muſt rather obey God than mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And of this wil of God <hi>Deborah</hi> was both a prophecier and an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. She had declared that <hi>Siſera</hi> was now reiected of God, and had openly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that he ſhould be ſold into the hand of a woman.</p>
                  <p>After this maner the <hi>Leuites</hi> when they had ſlaine their friendes &amp; kinſfolkes followed <hi>Moyſes:</hi> to whom <hi>Moyſes</hi> in the name of God ſaid, ye haue conſecrated your handes, ſo farre was it of that they were reproued for violating the bondes of kinred. <hi>Ieremy</hi> alſo, when by the commaundement of God hee had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the <hi>Moabites</hi> ſhoulde be kylled, he curſed thoſe which had withdrawen themſelues from that murther. He is curſed (ſaid he) which doth the woorke of the Lord deceatefully. In the lawe alſo it is commaunded, that none ſhoulde be ſpared which entiſed any to idolatry, no not the Father, nor the Mother, no nor he or ſhe which ſleepeth in thy boſome. Who ſeeth not here that moſt ſtrayghte bondes of kinred are to be contemned, if the wil and woord of God be againſt it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Abraham</hi> was commaunded to kyl his ſonne, and that his onely ſonne, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching whom he had receaued a moſt large promiſe. The promiſe of God and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes ſeemed to be againſt his precept, and yet againſt theſe thynges, the woord of God vrging him, he ought to haue kylled his ſonne. So muſt we think, that al men, although they be night of kyn vnto vs, ar ſacrifices vnto god, as many as he commaundeth to be ſlayne. Wherefore in <hi>Eſay</hi> the .xxxiiii. chap. it is written:<note place="margin">What happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto them that be prepoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly gentle.</note> The Lord hath a ſacrifice in <hi>Bozra.</hi> But they which wyth a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous clemency wyl againſt the woord of God be merciful, let them remember what happened vnto the king of <hi>Samaria.</hi> He, when he had ſpared <hi>Benadab</hi> the king of <hi>Siria,</hi> contrary to the commaundement of god, he was in this maner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the name of god by the Prophet. Thy ſoule ſhalbe for his ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore <hi>Iahel</hi> in this place is not to be blamed, foraſmuch as ſhe obeyed the counſel of god, and was excellently commended in the ſong of <hi>Deborah,</hi> as wee ſhal ſtraightway ſee. And vndoubtedly this her worke came of a great fayth and ſingular obedience. I know that ſome thinke, that the act of <hi>Iahel</hi> is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, in that ſhe killed <hi>Siſera,</hi> and had ſo ready a mynde to ſet at libertye the Iſraelites: but yet they condemne the lye which ſhe made, and the promiſe wher in ſhe promiſed that ſhe would hide and defend him. For ſhe ſaid: turn in to me, turne in to me, I pray thee my Lord, be not afeard. By which kinde of ſpech ſhe ſeemed to promiſe him not to betray him to his enemies. I alſo woulde affirme the ſame, but that I ſee that god was the gouernour of this whole enterpriſe. I haue before taught, that it is lawful to vſe guile, and that euil guile againſt our enemies, and that certaine proditions are iuſt. But I added, that there ſhoulde be mingled no promiſes nor lyes, nor othes with them. But al theſe thinges are to be vnderſtand by the common law. But if god ſhal ſtyrre vs vp to doo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there ſhalbe no blame layde in vs, if we obey him: ſo that we be very aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that god will haue it ſo to be done. And this is not to be left out, that ſome thinke, that <hi>Iahel</hi> at the beginning, when ſhe called <hi>Siſera</hi> vnto her, thought of no guile or fraude towardes him: but that ſhe was minded to keepe hym ſafe, as ſhe had promiſed: but afterward ſhe chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged her purpoſe, bicauſe god had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that ſhe ſhould otherwyſe woorke.</p>

The Ethnikes alſo when they had obtayned victories, were wont to appoynt ſupplications for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne dayes, which in deede was nothing els, than to geue thankes vnto God. Wherefore being moued with the occaſion of this place, I thinke it good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſpeake of Songes and Muſicke, as much as belongeth to piety. Fyrſte, from whence they had their beginning, and to what ende they were inſtituted. Secondlye, whither they may be kept in the Churches. Laſtlye, what kinde of ſonges and meaſures are profitable and healthful.</p>
                  <p>As touching the firſt, we muſt vnderſtand that the men of the olde tyme were wont with common vowes to ſing certain ſolemn ditties, both when they gaue thankes to god, and alſo when they endeuoured to obtayne anye thyng of hym.

For although ſynging of it ſelfe delighteth the myndes of men, yet when woordes are ioyned vnto it, which are of a iuſt number, and bound by certaine feete (as we ſee verſes are) it is then made much more pleaſaunt.

                     <note place="margin">The godlye much vſed holy ſonges.</note>But holy ſonges the people of God muche vſed. For the Hebrues in <hi>Moyſes</hi> time, when they tooke vp the Arke of the couenaunt, in their remouing of theyr tentes, ſang this ſong: Let God ariſe and deſtroy his enemies. Neither did they ſet it downe without ſome godlye ſong, as it is wrytten in the booke of <hi>Numb.</hi> Furthermore, in the Tabernacle &amp; in the Temple which was built by <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the <hi>Leuites</hi> at houres appointed wer preſent &amp; ſang holy himnes before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde in the hearing of the people, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue thanks vnto God, they moſt ſwete<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye celebrated certayne notable benefites which he had beſtowed on his people, and they adioyned prayers and added ſentences to the information of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and lyfe of godly men.

Which laudable cuſtome our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſemeth to haue followed, when after the Paſchal ſupper, in the night wherin he was betrayed, he went out together with his Diſciples into the mount Oliuet, when thei had ſaid an himne.<note place="margin">An example of Helizeus.</note> And of what force holye muſicke is to pacifye the affectes of the mynde, <hi>Helizeus</hi> teſtifieth, who being in minde ſomewhat moued agaynſte the king of Iſrael, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded one that plaied on an inſtrument to be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo in playing before <hi>Saul,</hi> brideled the violence of the euyll ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite wherewith <hi>Saul</hi> was oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>But why Muſicke ſeemeth ſo to rapte men in a maner wholye, the reaſon is plaine.<note place="margin">Muſike doth in a maner ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole man.</note> For there are certain pleaſures, which onely fyl the outward ſenſes, and there are others alſo, which pertain onely to the minde or reaſon.

I wyll not ſpeake, howe the Poetes fable, that when the walles of <hi>Thebes</hi> the Citye were built, the ſtones of their owne motion came together with the ſound of the Harpe.

                     </note>But now that we haue ſene the nature, beginning and vſe of ſonges and mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſicke: ther reſteth to inquire, whither it may be vſed in Churches. In the Eaſt part the holy aſſemblies, euen from the beginning, vſed ſinging, which we maye eaſily vnderſtand by a teſtimony of <hi>Plini</hi> in a certain Epiſtle to <hi>Traian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: where he writeth that Chriſtians vſed to ſyng hymnes before daye vnto their Chriſt. And this is not to be left out, that theſe words wer written in that time that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt lyued, for he was a liue vnto the time of <hi>Traian.</hi> Wherfore if a man ſhal ſay, that in the time of the Apoſtles there was ſyngyng
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18396:109"/> in holy aſſemblies. He ſhal not ſtray from the truth. <hi>Paule,</hi> who was before theſe times, vnto the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſaith: Be not filled wyth wyne, wherein is wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but be ye filled with the ſpirit, ſpeaking to your ſelues in Pſalmes, Himnes and ſpiritual ſonges, ſinging in your hart, geuing thankes alwaies vnto God, for all thinges, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. To wyne the Apoſtle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſpirite as contrarye: and forbiddeth the pleaſure of the ſenſes, when in ſteede of wyne he wil haue Chriſtians filled with the ſpirite. For in wine (as he ſaith) is wantonnes: but in the ſpirite is both a true and a perfect ioy. Drounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerdes ſpeake more than inough, but yet fooliſh and vayne thinges: Speake ye (ſaith he) but yet ſpirituall thinges, and that not onely in voyce, but alſo in hart: for the voyce ſoundeth in vaine, where the minde is not affected. They which be filled with wine, do ſpeake fooliſh, filthy, and blaſphemous thinges: but geue ye thankes to God, alwaies (I ſay) and for all thinges.</p>
                  <p>To this ende vndoubtedly ought Eccleſiaſtical ſonges to tend vnto. To the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> alſo are written certaine thinges not diſagreing from theſe. Let the woord of the Lord (ſayth the Apoſtle) abound plentifully in you: teache and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh ye one another in Pſalmes, Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſonges, ſinging in your hartes with grace. By theſe woordes <hi>Paule</hi> expreſſeth two thinges. Fyrſt, that our ſonges be the woord of God, which muſt abound plentifully in vs, and they muſt not ſerue onely to geuing of thankes, but alſo to teache and to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. And then it is added, with grace, which is thus to vnderſtand, as though he ſhould haue ſaid, aptly and properly both to the ſenſes, and to meaſure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto the voyces.

Yea and the Pope alſo, Cardinals, Biſhops &amp; Abbots, when they haue heard ſonges of Maſſes and Euenſonges, do oftentimes pronounce vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the people indulgences of ſynnes. This vice alſo is to be taken away, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging be not ſo much occupied in the Churche, that there bee no time in a maner left for to preach the woord of God and holy doctrine, as they doo almoſt euerye wher. For they ſo chaunt all thinges with ſynging and piping, that there is no part of the time reſerued for preaching. Wherby it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple depart out of the Church ful of Muſick and harmony, but yet hungerſtoruen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and faſting as touching heauenly doctrine. Moreouer, ſo riche &amp; large ſtipendes are appointed for Muſicians, that either very litle, or in a maner nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided for the Miniſters which labor in the woord of God. Neither may that bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> &amp; quauering Muſicke be lawfully retayned, wherewith the ſtanders by are ſo letted, that they cannot vnderſtand the wordes, no though they woulde. We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> muſt alſo take heede, that in the Church nothing be ſoong without choyſe, but onely thoſe thinges which are contained in the holy ſcriptures, or which are by iuſt reaſons gathered out of them, and do exactly agree with the woord of God. For if there ſhould be a wyndow opened vnto the inuentions of men, it wer to be feared, leaſt Eccleſiaſtical Muſicke ſhould at the laſt be chaunged into trifles and fables. Yea, we already ſee, that there are brought into the aſſemblye verye many fooliſh Sequences (as they call them) and fayned Hymnes, and manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges alſo which doo ſtyrre vp vnto the hearers rather a laughter and a wearynes,<note place="margin">Hymnes of Ambroſe.</note> than a true fayth. Neither doo I ſpeake theſe thinges as thoughe I would diſprayſe the Hymnes of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and other whiche are of that kynde, foraſmuch as by them I iudge that the faythful maye be both inſtructed, and alſo admoniſhed.<note place="margin">The Symbole of Athanaſius.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if in theſe daies we ſhal perceaue, that the Chriſtian people do runne vnto the Churches as to a ſtage play, where they may be delighted with piping &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, in this caſe we muſt rather abſtaine from a thing not neceſſarye, than to ſuffer their pleaſures to be cockered with the deſtruction of their ſoules.

                  <p>The firſt is: That god in oppreſſing the Iſraelites, and deliuering them to the <hi>Chananites,</hi> reuenged the iniury that was done vnto himſelfe, wherein they dyd grieuouſly offende hym, when they fel to impietye and Idolatrye.

                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:111"/>
                  <p>For the Saintes when they haue fallen, are wont by ſcourges wherewith they are puniſhed to be called backe againe to repentaunce, which repentaunce God poureth in them by diuers and many vexations. The third ſenſe is, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, and almoſt receaued of al men: That they ſhould geue thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, which at the laſt had reuenged the iniuries of the Iſraelites. For they were before long time, &amp; that grieuouſly oppreſſed by the <hi>Chananites.</hi> And then by the ſpirite of God they were made willing and prompt, which before were ſuch abiectes and cowardes. Two thinges therfore are expreſſed, namely, that God confounded the <hi>Chananites,</hi> in reuenging the euyls whyche they had done vnto the Iewes, and alſo that he ſtrengthened them in the battaile. If God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged them,<note place="margin">We do not aſk thoſe things of God whiche ar in our own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</note> they by them ſelues coulde not reuenge themſelues. If he made them willing, they themſelues were not ſuch. Wherfore free wyl is put down, and the goodnes of god commended. For euen as we doo not aſke of god thoſe thinges which we haue in our own hands and power: ſo for theſe things when they happen vnto vs, we geue him no thankes.</p>

The welles or fountaynes whiche were without the cities by the ſtreates and highe wayes, could ſtande the Iewes in no ſteade, by reaſon of the Chananites whiche kept away al thinges. For the horſemen which were archers, hidde them ſelues priuely neare ſuch waters, and aſſayled thoſe which came forth to draw water there. Many of them they led away captiues, and with theyr noyſe and cry, they feared away in a manner all from drawinge of water.

The Summe is: That it is not lawfull for a man, to curſe any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the ſatiſfieng of his owne anger. For when our own matters are in hand, we muſt loue our enemies: &amp; we muſt bleſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which curſe vs. But when God doth ſomtimes certainely make manifeſt, that he will haue ſome deſtroyed, they whiche are ſo admoniſhed of his wil, can not but allow it, for by the ſpirite wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are inſpired, they wil alſo the ſame thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God wil.

Howbeit when we ſee ſome men cruelly to rage agaynſte the godly men and Goſpell of God, it is lawfull in that caſe to praye, that either theyr will may be chaunged, or theyr ſtrength confounded, that they ſhoulde not accomplyſhe all the things which they appoint to do.

                  <p>In the laſt part of the ſonge, to the end we might manifeſtly ſee, to how great a confuſion and ignominy the enemies of God came vnto, and from how great a hope they fell, the perſon of the mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> is brought in, and the wordes both of her, and of other noble women which wer together with her, ar ſetforth. She might haue ſayd in few words: The mother wayted, that her ſonne ſhould returne with glory and laden with ſpoyles, whome the wretched woman knew not to haue ſo myſerably periſhed. But if ſhe ſhoulde ſo haue ſayde, the oration would haue bene ſlender and cold. Wherefore to make it of efficacye and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> talke of the women is put here. Which maner alſo was very much vſed amonge the Ethnike writers, and it is reade alſo in <hi>Eſay</hi> the .14. chap. where is expreſſed the talke of kinges and princes which were deade,<note place="margin">A figuratiue ſpeech is not to be accuſed as a lye.</note> with which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the king of Babilon being miſerablye deſtroyed and diſcendinge downe vnto them. Neither do the holy writers lye when they fayne ſuch thinges, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>much as they write not to deceaue, but to declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing more openly. The mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therly affection, &amp; vehement naturall loue of the parentes towards the children is here expreſſed, whiche for the longe abſence of theyr children are very muche carefull, and are many wayes afflicted. It is ſayd therefore that the mother of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera,</hi> whileſt he deſired to returne, beinge troubled euen herſelfe oftentimes, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out at the windowes or thorow the lateſſes beyonde the windowes, to ſee if ſhe could ſee him returninge. And this ſhe did not without crieng and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuſpecting by this his long tarying that euill had happened vnto him. But the women which ſtode by had a great deale better hope, for they interpreted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tarying of <hi>Siſera</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good part. <hi>Terence</hi> in <hi>Adelphis</hi> hath notably wel writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is much better,<note place="margin">Terence</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs which our wiues in our abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of vs, then thoſe thinges whiche our parentes ſuſpect. For when a man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth longe in a place, the wife ſayth with her ſelfe he loueth, or is loued, he is a drinkinge, his minde is pleaſed, and he is in ſo good caſe, that he forgetteth to returne home. But the parentes when theyr ſonnes return not in time, by and by they are afraid, leaſt they haue had ſome fal, leſt they be a cold, or haue broken ſomethinge, and till ſuch time as they returne they are wonderfull carefull. Nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther do I rehearſe theſe thinges without a cauſe, bicauſe the old tranſlation, wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that moſt wiſe princeſſe of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which talked together wyth the mother of <hi>Siſera,</hi> was <hi>Siſeras</hi> wife. Wherfore it is no marueile if ſhe were in better hope then his mother. But bicauſe heuy thinges are not pleaſaunte, and euen by the inſtincte of nature we fly from them, therefore they which vpon ſuſpicion are he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy do eaſely receaue comfort. Wherefore it is now written, that the mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> was ſo ſatiſfied with the wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman whiche comforted her, that ſhe herſelfe with the ſame wordes aunſwered her ſelfe. When ſhee was pricked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſorow &amp; heauines. The ſome of the comfort was, that the victory was altoge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther on <hi>Siſeras</hi> ſide, but his returne was differed to diſtribute the ſpoile whiche they had taken, and foraſmuch as the ſame diſtribution oughte iuſtly to be done, namely to geue vnto euery one according to his eſtate, laboure, and deſert, and for that in ſo greate an hoſt very many thinges are to be deuided after ſo noble a victory: it could not therfore be done in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>Thys Hebrew word <hi>Racham,</hi> ſignifieth not properly a maid: but yet ſo muſt we tranſlate it, bicauſe that woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being an enemy of the Iewes ſpeaketh with greate contempt of the Hebrew wemen, and nameth them by the ſecrete parte of the body, namely by the belly and womb. It is ſpoken by the fygure <hi>Sinechdoche</hi> but very bitterly. For ſhe ſignifyeth that they were vnchaſte, and appoynted to vnhoneſt vſe. And foraſmuch as the more noble rewardes are wont to be geuen vnto princes and the beſt thinges to the captaine of the whole hoſt, therefore ſhe ſayth, to euery man ſhalbe geuen a mayde or two, that is, the praye of the raſcall ſouldiours ſhalbe bondmen or bonde women be geuen. But to our <hi>Siſera</hi> ſhalbe geuen the moſt worthieſt thinges, garmentes I ſay of diuers colours and nedle

And the ſame writer attributeth vnto the <hi>Babilonians</hi> the inuention of diuers coloures in garmentes, and euen as garmentes of ſiluer which were found out in <hi>Aſia</hi> vnder <hi>Attalus</hi> the king, were called <hi>Attalical,</hi> ſo thoſe garmentes whiche were by the <hi>Phrigians</hi> wroughte with the nedle, beinge ſet out with golde and ſundry coloures and pictures, wer called <hi>Phrigionical.</hi> And for that theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhippes wer in the old time had in eſtimation, god would haue the holy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and the high prieſtes garmentes wrought with nedle worke. And this is not to be paſſed ouer, that by the ciuile lawes it was not lawefull for euerye man to weare ſuch precious garmentes. Wherfore it is ſayd now in this ſong, that garmentes of ſundry coloures, and ſuch as were wrought with the nedle ar attributed only to the prince.

                  <p>Firſt of all it is written, that Iſraell ſinned, to the end we might vnderſtande that they were iuſtly puniſhed. The kind of theyr ſynne (as we ſhall afterwarde ſee) was idolatry. And the puniſhment which followed was their deliuery vnto the <hi>Madianites</hi> to be vexed of them.

                     <hi>Madian</hi> (if we may credite <hi>Ierome</hi>) was a citye ſo called of a certaine ſonne of <hi>Araham</hi> whome he begat of his laſt wife <hi>Ketura.</hi> It lieth beyond <hi>Arabia</hi> toward the South, in the deſert of the <hi>Seracens,</hi> not far from the Sea called <hi>Erithreum.</hi> And theſe people were called <hi>Madianites,</hi> and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture by an other name more in vſe with the <hi>Ethnikes,</hi> namely <hi>Maudrenites.</hi> From thence <hi>Moſes</hi> hadde his wife and of them alſo came the <hi>Kenites,</hi> whiche went together with <hi>Moſes</hi> into the land of <hi>Chanaan.</hi> And laſtly from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thoſe black men ar thought to haue theyr ofſpring, which in our times wander euery wher, and of ſome are called <hi>Egiptians:</hi> they dwell in tentes: and beinge very the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhe

Thoſe fyrſte places were in bankes of hilles, and were ſo called bicauſe from the vpper partes, they had certayne chinckes and holes, which were like windowes, ſo that throughe them they had light ſufficient within. And the ſame places were very handſome for men to dwel in them. <hi>R.

For dennes wer not in mountaynes, but places vnder the earth in the fields being dark &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out light, wherein men did not dwel, but they mighte after a ſorte hide their things and goods. But caues in lattin are called <hi>Specus, a ſpeciendo,</hi> which is to behold and to looke vpon, bycauſe out of them as out of highe places they whyche were there, vſed to looke through. They made alſo <hi>fenced places</hi> as bulwarckes and caſtels, which might be openly ſene, but that they could not be conquered.

                  <p>The maner whereby the Iſraelites wer ſtirred vp to cal vpon God, is in this place ſet forth. They were turned vnto God by the impulſion of faythe, whyche was ſtirred vp by the preaching of the woord of God: for he had ſent vnto them a man which was a Prophet, not legions of Angels, not a multitude of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, not armour, neither warlike engins. He directed vnto them a Preacher &amp; Miniſter of the woord of God. And this ought not to ſeme abſurd, if this verbe <hi>Vaiiſchlah</hi> be interpretated in the ſignification of the preterpluperfect tenſe, for as much as it is a thing very much vſed in the holy ſcriptures. And yet I denye
<pb facs="tcp:18396:120"/> not, that this place may be vnderſtand an other way: namely that the Iſraelites in dede cried firſt, but yet with a certaine violence ſtirred vp by troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeries, which violence by it ſelf, could not be allowed of God, nether had it obtai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned any thing at his handes, except it had bene adorned with a true faith &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect repentaunce: for the bringing to paſſe wherof, God not forgetting his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſent them a Prophet or Preacher meete thereunto. Howbeit the firſt ſenſe, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth al the preterpluperfectnes, pleaſeth me very wel: although I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but that both waies may be admitted.

But I iudge that it is wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of ſome one certaine prophet, which was of great authority among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues. And I am not ignorant that ſome thinke this prophet to haue ben an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel: which I allow not, foraſmuch as he is called both a man and a prophet.

The Hebrues thinke that this Prophet was <hi>Phineas,</hi> of whom alſo they ſaye that it is written in the firſt booke of <hi>Paralip.</hi> the .ix. chap. that he liued in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> when as for all that the ſame place may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bee expounded. But who hee was, it maketh no great matter. We muſt rather marke the argument of the ſermon, whiche is in fewe woordes toutched. Firſt, the benefites of God are rehearſed: their deliuery I ſay out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were deliuered from ſeruitude moſt grieuous: his defence againſt thoſe which went about to oppreſſe them: and laſtly, the poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> God had now faithfully performed al theſe thinges, as hee had promyſed vnto their fathers. Whereby it manifeſtly appeareth that the couenaunt made with the fathers, was on his part kept vnuiolated. Let vs note in theſe wordes, that God at that time was by this title praiſed, namely bicauſe he had deliuered his people out of <hi>Egipt:</hi> for his nature otherwiſe is moſt farre remoued from the mindes of men, neither can it any otherway be knowen, but by the effects. But of this thing I haue inough ſpoken, as much as ſemed ſufficient. Wherefore it is manifeſt that the Preacher which was ſent from God, doth beate into the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues the benefite which they had receaued, namelye both to ſtirre vp in the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites the knowledge of the true God, and alſo to ſhewe foorth hys truth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with conſtancy.</p>

                  <p>This place may be enterpreted two maner of waies. One way it is thought that <hi>Gideon</hi> would haue made redy a dinner for the man of God: for ſuch a one did he take him to be. Therfore for honours ſake he deſired to refreſh him wyth meate in his iourney, &amp; to talk with him at leaſure for the ſhewing of the ſigne. And he thought not that God or an Angel was preſent with him. Wherfore he thought to folow the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Lot.</hi> And in dede the things which he preſented, partained rather to a dinner, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a ſacrifice. He erected no alter, neither prepared he the fat to be burnt, nor the ſhoulder and the breſt to be lifted vp, nor the blood to be ſhed. The other interpretation is, that he would therfore bring him a ſacrifice, that in that oblation he might obtayne a ſigne, as to <hi>Abel</hi> the fauour of God was declared when he was offring ſacrifice. And the authors of this ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence beleue that this doth nothing let that <hi>Gideon</hi> ſod the fleſh,<note place="margin">Fleſh in ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſod.</note> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that kind of ſething was ſometimes vſed in peace offrings, as the fyrſt booke of <hi>Samuel</hi> teſtifieth.

                     <hi>Gideon</hi> intended to offer ſacrifices: But I rather allow the firſt ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as touching the feaſt, although I know that the Angell contrary to <hi>Gideons</hi> purpoſe vſed that meate to a ſacrifice, and in it gaue the ſigne, which a little before was deſired of him.

For the Elders were carefull to prepare meate for ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers with as much ſpeede as might be.

This meaſure <hi>Ephah</hi> was not a meaſure for liquide thinges, but for thinges dry, and (as the Hebrues affirme) it held thre peckes, and a pecke contained .144. egges.

And that all compoſition is agaynſt the nature of God, euen the Ethnike Philoſophers perceaued.</p>
                  <p>But leauing the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> we muſt ſpeake of certayne other, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Paulinam, de videndo Deo,</hi> maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion of.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> They as the Scriptures teſtifie and the right faith confeſſe, do beleue that God is alto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether moſt ſimple, and that he wanteth a body. But they deny that he can not
<pb facs="tcp:18396:125"/> be ſene with the eyes of the bleſſed, in that bleſſedneſſe whiche we wayt for. And therfore they ſay we are deceaued, bycauſe we meaſure the ſtate of the lyfe to come by thoſe thinges, whiche we ſee here to be done and to happen. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, although the dull eyes of our body are not able here to ſee God, the aungels or ſpirites, yet when they are confirmed in felicity, they ſhall ſee them, but not in dede by their owne nature &amp; power, and the ſharpeneſſe of their ſight ſhalbe ſo illuſtrated,<note place="margin">Our bodely eyes do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God neither here, neither in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe to come.</note> that they ſhall ſee euen the very eſſence of God. Theſe men peraduenture erre leſſe than the <hi>Anthropomorphites:</hi> but yet they erre. For how ſoeuer our eyes ſhalbe confirmed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhalbe in the bleſſed ſtate, they ſhall for all that remayne eyes, and ſhalbe bodily eyes: wherfore they ſhall not excede the nature and latitude of their obiectes. In dede they ſhall then eaſely abide a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter and larger light, than now they can in ſeing ſuffer, neither ſhall they be hurte by thoſe colours wherwith they are now offended, but yet they ſhall not attayne vnto the eſſence of god. For there are no bodies whiche in the bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhalbe ſo nobled, that they ſhall either be made ſpirites, or els ceaſſe to be bodyes. Wherfore neither to the body of Chriſt is this geuen, that after his re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurrection it was turned into a ſpirite. For this were not to haue the body riſe agayne, but to be aboliſhed. Wherfore they, whiche thinke that our eyes ſhalbe made ſo perfect, that they ſhall beholde the ſubſtaunce of God, do not beawtifye them, but in very dede deſtroy them. The <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> do ſinne agaynſt the nature of God, in that they cloth it with a body: but theſe men do iniury vnto the nature of man, which perſuade themſelues that it ſhall not abide in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſurrection. Our ſentence therfore abideth and is true, as well of this lyfe wherin we preſently lyue, as of the life which we wayte for to come.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches and Prophets ſaw.</note>But thou wilt aſke, what then ſawe the Patriarches and Prophetes, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we read in the holy Scriptures that God many tymes appeared? I aunſwere, that as touching the outward ſenſes, they ſaw onely certaine images, ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and formes, whiche were offred ſometymes vnto them by god and by hys aungels, whereby it was ſhewed both that he was preſent with thoſe fathers, &amp; alſo ſpake vnto them, heard them and admoniſhed them of thinges healthfull. But theſe things, namely the preſence of god or of the aungels, alſo the wordes and ſignifications, the ſenſe it ſelfe vnderſtand not, but by reaſon, and in minde they were gathered by thoſe thinges, whiche the iudgement of the ſenſes recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Wherfore the <hi>Chaldey</hi> Paraphraſt, when in <hi>Exodus</hi> it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that god came to mount <hi>Syna,</hi> affirmeth, that god himſelfe came not ſimply, but tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, that the glory of god came: as thoughe he ſhould haue ſayd, certaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wonderfull ſignes were there ſene, by whiche god teſtified that he hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was there preſent: whiche ſelfſame thing he doth in <hi>Eſay</hi> the 6. chap: where he writeth.<note place="margin">In what thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs God ſhew him ſelf to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> I ſaw the Lord ſitting vpon his throne which was highe and lifted vp. But what manner of ſimilitudes and images they were, which offred them ſelues as tokens of the preſence either of an aungell or of god, it is eaſy to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the holy Scriptures. The burnyng buſhe appeared vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the cloud, the piller of fire, the ſmokes, voices, thundringes lampes, lightnings, the propiciatory, the arke of the couenaunt, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Themim,</hi> and ſondry for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes euen of men, whiche either did, or ſpake, or in ſome maner of ſorte ſhewed themſelues either to Prophetes or to other men. All theſe thynges I ſaye, were ſignes and tokens of the preſence both of God and of the aungels. And the ſame things were ſene of the fathers, either when they were ſlepyng or els whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were waking: &amp; ſometymes by the ſpirit of god or induſtry of the angels at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of god,<note place="margin">Prophets ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times ſe things printed in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and ſomtimes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phantaſy or imagination of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receaued forme by ſuch ſimilitudes and figures. Wherby thoſe thinges whiche god would ſhewe, were no leſſe expreſſed in the myndes of the vnderſtanders, than if they had ben perceaued by the outward ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore in expounding the Prophetes it is true, that very oftentymes we
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18396:125"/> ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in great doubt, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing were ſo done outwardly, or rather ſo appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet to be done in mind. And in certain of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſon of the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the matter, we are compelled to graunt that it was onely a viſion, as <hi>Ierome</hi> teſtifieth of the breeches or hoſen of <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ierome.</note> whiche at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord he put in a rocke by the riuer <hi>Euphrates:</hi> and he ſuffred them to remayne there ſo long, till they were rotten: and then he was commaunded to take them, and to put them on agayne. And this viſion happened whileſt the city of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was grieuouſly beſieged by the <hi>Chaldeyans,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophet could not go and come to the riuer <hi>Euphrates.</hi> For at the ſame tyme, when he would once haue gone to <hi>Anathoth,</hi> where he was borne, he was taken eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was going out of the gates, and accuſed of treaſon. In like manner the ſame <hi>Ierome</hi> affirmeth, that that was onely done by a viſion, whiche is written in <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> of the bread baked in the doung of an oxe, and how it lay many dayes vpon one and the ſelfe ſame ſide. To theſe may be added the eatyng of the booke, and ſuch like, whiche either humane nature, or circumſtances of the matters and tymes, ſuffred not ſo to be done, as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as touching the preaching &amp; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto the people, that things which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophetes had in their myndes, a thing ſene by phantaſy or imagination, was all one, and had as much efficacy, as if it had outwardly bene ſene. But yet they fled not vnto the viſions of the mynde, when the thing it ſelfe might outwardly be done. For ſeyng God can vſe both wayes, he hath ſometymes taken this way, and other ſometymes that way, as it hath pleaſed him, and as he hath iudged mete and profitable for vs. But in all theſe things, me thinketh the ſentence of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is to be holden,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> The viſions of Prophets wer not naturall.</note> which intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe images, ſayeth: That they were ſuch as will did choſe, and not ſuch as nature hath formed: whiche vndoubtedly maketh agaynſt thoſe, whiche will haue propheſieng to be naturall, as though by the power of the heauens, or ſome certain inſtinct of nature, or temperature of humors ſuch images &amp; ſights offred themſelues to be ſene, of the outward ſenſes of the Prophetes, or to be knowen inwardly by imagination &amp; phantaſy. The will (ſayth <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) namely of god or of an aungell, would thoſe thinges, and aboue other thinges choſe them, and not the power of nature formed them.</p>
                  <p>But there is an other doubt which in dede is not to be left vnſpoken of,<note place="margin">Whether God at any tyme ſhewed himſelf or whether they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes angels that appeared.</note> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely whether god himſelfe at any tyme ſhewed himſelfe vnder theſe images or formes: Or whether onely aungels alwayes appeared, which wrought &amp; ſpake with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets, ſometimes in theyr own name, &amp; other ſometyme in the name of god? Ther haue ben ſome which ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god himſelf neuer appeared, but by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of god all thoſe things were acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed which are written to be either ſpoken or done in thoſe viſions. And they contend that they haue certayne teſtimonies in the Scriptures which make with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: among which one is found in the Actes of the Apoſtles, where <hi>Stephen</hi> expreſſedly calleth him an aungell, whiche called to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the buſhe, when as for all that he is in <hi>Exodus</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med God. Farther <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians</hi> teſtifieth that the lawe was geuen in the hande of a Mediator, be the diſpoſition of Aungels. And no man doubteth, but that in <hi>Exodus</hi> it is written, that the law was geuen by god. Wherfore they conclude that we muſt vnderſtand that God appeared not by himſelfe, but by Aungels. Howbeit foraſmuch as the eſſence or diuine nature, can not be taken away either from the holy ghoſt,<note place="margin">The holy ghoſt ſhewed himſelf in a Doue.</note> or from the ſonne (for either of them by nature is God) how will they defend their opinion, when as it is expreſſedly written in the goſpell, that the holy ghoſt deſcended vpon Chriſt in the forme of a Doue? If they ſay that an aungell came and not the holy ghoſt, they accuſe the Scripture as a lyer: but if they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that together with that Doue the holy ghoſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what ſhall let but that god himſelfe alſo appeared vnto the fathers vnder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figures and images? They ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from this by no meanes eſcape, except (which I thinke they wil not do: otherwiſe they ſhould bring in a manifeſt hereſy) they
<pb facs="tcp:18396:126"/> will deny the holy ghoſt to be God. And that which I haue aunſwered of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, we may obiect the like of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, out of the wordes of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothe</hi> the 3.<note place="margin">The ſonne of God appeared in humane fleſh</note> chap, where he writeth: Without controuerſy it is a great miſtery, god is made manifeſt in the fleſh, iuſtified in the ſpirite, &amp;c. For the whole Churche and right faith confeſſeth that the word was the true god whiche appeared vnder the fleſhe of man. Whiche if he did, as vndoubtedly without conterfayting he did, why may he not be ſaid to haue done the ſame in the old Teſtament vnder ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry formes and manifolde figures? Without doubt that was much greater whiche he gaue vnto vs in the latter tyme. But he whiche hath geuen the greater thing we doubt not but that he alſo can geue that whiche is leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Peraduenture they will ſay, that that whiche was geuen in the latter tyme, the holy Scriptures do ſet forth to the end we ſhould beleue it: but that whiche ye require to haue ben done in the old time is no where read.<note place="margin">It is the word or ſonne of god by whom God ſpake vnto the fathers &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes.</note> Yea but if we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently marke, the Scriptures teach, that alſo. For the ſonne of god is named by the Euangeliſt the worde or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whiche we muſt beleue was not by him done raſhly, but bycauſe it might be vnderſtand that by him god ſpake, when the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures teſtifie that he ſpake. Wherfore as often as we read, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord came vnto this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or to that man, I iudge that the ſame is ſo often to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the ſonne of god Chriſt our Lord, namely that god by him ſpake vnto the fathers and Prophetes. Which leaſt I ſhould ſeme to ſpeake in vayne, I wil for this ſentence bring forth two teſtimonies.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> The firſt is read in the firſt chap: of <hi>Iohn:</hi> No man hath ſene god at any tyme, &amp; ſtraight way by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure <hi>Occupatio</hi> is added. The ſonne which is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father he hath reueled hym. For a man might aſke, If no man haue ſene god at any tyme, who appeared then to the fathers when things deuine wer ſhewed vnto them? who talked with them, when ſondry formes and images appeared vnto them in the name of god,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.</note> and wrought with them? Straight way it is aunſwered: The ſonne which is in the boſome of the father he hath reueled him: he was to man, the moſt true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the father. An other place, is in the goſpell the 12. chap: where it is thus word for word writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore they could not beleue, bycauſe agayn ſayd <hi>Eſay:</hi> He hath blinded their eyes, &amp; hardened their hart, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with their hart, and ſhould be conuerted, and I ſhould heale them. Theſe thinges ſayd <hi>Eſay,</hi> when he ſaw his glory, and ſpake of hym. Vndoubtedly theſe two pronounes His, and of Him, do without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify Chriſt, for a litle before the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt had ſayd, Though he, namely Chriſt, had done ſo many ſignes before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet beleued they not in hym, that the ſaying of <hi>Eſay</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet might be fulfilled y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſayd, &amp;c. And to this ſentence, which in very dede is natural, do agree <hi>Chriſoſtome, Ierome, Cirillus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the wordes of <hi>Hoſea</hi> the Prophet which he hath in the 12.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 12</note> chap: are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be weighed, And thus ſpeaketh the Lord there: I haue ſpoken vnto the Prophetes, and I haue multiplied viſions, and vſed ſimilitudes by the hand of the Prophetes, &amp;c. Hereby we vnderſtand, that ſimilitudes were not geuen vnto the Prophetes from the beginning, but god himſelfe ſpake vnto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">By examples it is declared both that God himſelfe, &amp; alſo that a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes appered</note>But now muſt we by examples and ſuch as are moſt euident, confirme, that the appearynges of god are vtterly diſtinct from the viſions of aungels. Firſt it is declared vnto vs in the boke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw a ladder which reached from earth euen to heauen, and by it the aungels both aſcended and diſcended. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And at the top of the ladder, namely in heauen, ſtode the Lord from whom <hi>Iacob</hi> heard noble and large promiſes. Hereby is gathered, vnleſſe we wil ſtil be blind, that aungels ſhewed themſelues in one kind of images and god himſelf appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in an other forme. This ſelfe ſame thing may we ſee in <hi>Eſay,</hi> when he ſawe the Lord ſitting in his throne, and with him two Seraphins, whiche cried mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the one to the other, Holy, holy, holy. And with ſo great reuerence they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18396:126"/> worſhipped God which was in the middeſt, that with their two vpper winges, they couered their face, and with the two neither wings their feete. Who ſeeth, not here a great difference betwene god and the aungels which appeared? I will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not ſpeake of <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> which ſaw aungels in the formes of creatures, namely of an Oxe, an Egle, and a Lion, by whom wheles were turned, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſat in the hygheſt parte in the forme of the ſonne of man. Of <hi>Daniell</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> was ſene the auncient of dayes, vnto whom came the ſonne of man. And he addeth that thrones were there put, bookes opened, and a certain forme of a iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement appoynted: then he maketh mencion of aungels, of which he ſayth were preſent ten thouſand and ten hundreth thouſand, whiche miniſtred vnto hym.</p>
                  <p>And here we heare, what great difference there is betwene God and the angels which miniſtred. Farther there is a place moſt manifeſt in <hi>Exodus,</hi> when God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> beyng angry with the people, denied that he would go any farther with them thorough the deſert, leaſt being prouoked with theyr ſinnes, he ſhuld at once vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy them. But he promiſed to ſend his aungell, with which promiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was not content, and ſayd that he would by no meanes go with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, except god himſelf would go together with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And vndoubtedly by prayer and conſtantly abiding in his ſentence, at the length he ouercame, and (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired) had god for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guide of their iorney. How can theſe men therfore ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god himſelfe was not preſent vnder thoſe formes, but only angels were ſene in ſuch images? Moreouer let vs remember, that <hi>Moſes</hi> (as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſame boke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of <hi>Exodus</hi>) deſired of God to ſee his face: which his requeſt god (for that he loued him excedingly,) would not vtterly deny, but yet he would not graunt him all that he required. Wherfore he aunſwered: My face thou ſhalt by no meanes ſee, bycauſe man ſhall not ſee me &amp; lyue, but thou ſhalt looke vpon my hinder parts, namely my backe. What is more manifeſt than this teſtimony? Surely god by certayne wordes here promiſeth, to appeare vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſhape of a man, of whoſe forme or image <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſee not the face but the backe. And the ſame he faythfully performed vnto <hi>Moſes:</hi> for as god paſſed by, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſawe the backe of his image by the rocke, and heard the wonderfull and noble names of god rehearſed with a moſt loude voyce. Which when he ſaw, he fell proſtrate to the earth and worſhipped: and it is not to be doubted, but that he gaue vnto hym that adoration, which is onely due vnto the onely god. For foraſmuch as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued that he was there preſent according vnto his promiſe it is not to be had in controuerſy, but that he worſhipped him as being preſent in very dede. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly god, except he had ſhewed himſelfe preſent in very dede at the arke &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> mercy ſeat, ſhould haue throwen the Iſraelites hedlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into idolatry, if he would haue had onely aungels to aunſwere ſuch as came to aſke counſell, for that he commaunded them to cal vpon him and to worſhip him there. To theſe may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> added that hiſtory whiche is written in the booke of kinges of <hi>Micheas</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whiche prophecied before <hi>Achab</hi> king of <hi>Iſraell</hi> and ſayd, that he ſawe god, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was preſent an hoſt of aungels, &amp; he heard him aſke, who ſhal deceaue <hi>Achab,</hi> and that one offred himſelf to be a lying ſpirite in the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes of the king <hi>Achab.</hi> By this viſion alſo we vnderſtand, that there was an aſſured and notable difference, betwene god and the aungels, whiche appeared all together vnto the Prophet. Wherfore the gift of god which he gaue vnto the fathers, is not to be diminiſhed or to be extenuated: &amp; we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was in very dede preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he appeared, foraſmuch as we reade y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was ſo done, and there is nothing that letteth, as farre as can be gathered out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, neither is the very nature of god any thing againſt, it that it could not be done. It were not ſound to attribute vnto aungels all thoſe things which in the ſcripture are read of ſuch viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For ſo might we eaſely ſlip ſo farre, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the laſt we ſhould beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the word was not immediatly created by god, but by angels at his commaundement. Wherfore let vs confeſſe that god was preſent in very
<pb facs="tcp:18396:127"/> dede,<note place="margin">God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in verye dede, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſayd that he ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peared vnder diuers formes.</note> &amp; ſhewed himſelfe vnder diuers formes, as often as we heare that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teſtifieth or ſpeaketh the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now reſteth to aunſwere vnto the places before brought. As touchyng the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> I graunt that the diſpoſition of the aungels was in the geuing of the law: for they ſtood by God when he ſpake, they made redy the miſt,<note place="margin">Aungels mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto god when he gaue the law.</note> thundringes, lightnings, &amp; la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pes, they prepared the tables of ſtone, &amp; many wayes miniſtred vnto God being preſent &amp; ſpeakyng. Neither do the wordes of the Apoſtle deny, but that God himſelfe ſpake, &amp; gaue the law, as the ſcriptures teſtifie. Yea &amp; there haue ben ſome, which by the hand of a Mediator, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to be <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The aungell which ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Moſes in the buſhe, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God</note> but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of god: but whether they do it rightly or wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I haue no leaſure at thys preſent to diſcuſſe. But we nede not in many wordes to aunſwere vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which bleſſed <hi>Stephen</hi> ſayth (as it is written in the Actes of the Apoſtles) namely that an angel appeared vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the buſhe, &amp; talked with him. For if by the angell we vnderſtand the ſonne of God (as I haue often admoniſhed) there will then remayne no doubt.</p>
                  <p>But that the things which I haue now alledged, as touching this matter, may the plainlyer &amp; more certeinly be vnderſtand, I thinke it good to confirme them by ſome teſtimonies of the fathers.<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in his 14. <hi>Homely</hi> vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith. The things which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers ſaw, were al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by permiſſion, but yet they ſaw not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure &amp; ſimple ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god. And he addeth: If they had ſene it, then ſhould they not haue ſene it in any part differing, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is pure, ſimple, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be deſcribed: Wherfore it ſtandeth not, it lieth not, neither ſitteth, as ſometime it was to thoſe Prophetes ſhewed. He ſaith moreouer: God, before the ſonne came into fleſh, exerciſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father with thoſe viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; images. He there alſo writeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, which a litle before we alledged, namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> with bodyly eyes we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirites, as are our ſoules &amp; angels. Wherfore much leſſe muſt we beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can ſee god with the ſenſes. And leaſt a man thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it onely agreeth with god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father to be inuiſible, &amp; not with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, he bringeth thys ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he is the image of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuiſible God. And without doubt he could not be hys image,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> if he were not inuiſible, as he is whoſe image he repreſenteth. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo in his 3. treatiſe vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Althoughe it be ſayd that he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with god face to face, yet when he deſired to ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face of god, that is his very ſubſtaunce, he could not obteyne it. And in the ſame place he addeth: He ſaw the cloude, &amp; the fire, which were figures. And within a litle after: If they ſay that the ſonne was viſible before he was incarnate, they dote. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> beſides theſe hath in his Epiſtle to <hi>Fortunatianus,</hi> gathered many more things to this purpoſe out of <hi>Nazianzenus, Ierome,</hi> &amp; other fathers, which wer to long here to rehearſe.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit I will bring two argumentes, which are wont to be obiected againſt this ſentence. In the beginning we ſayd that the nature of God can not therfore be comprehended with the ſenſes, bycauſe his nature is not bodily. But all the old fathers ſeme not to haue beleued ſo.<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> For <hi>Tertullian</hi> agaynſt <hi>Praxea</hi> writeth that God is a bodye, and in other places hee oftentimes teſtifieth the ſame. Yea in his litle booke <hi>de Anima</hi> he teacheth that our ſoules are bodyes. And whiche ſemeth more ſtraunge, hee laboureth by manye reaſons to confirme it. Yea and in his booke <hi>de Dogmat. Eccleſ.</hi> the 11. chap: he writeth that all creatures are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and euen the aungels by name: bycauſe there is nothing, whiche filleth all thinges as doth God: but all thynges are limited with certayne places, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth of the ſoule,<note place="margin">Auguſtine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</note> whiche is cloſed in with the body. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Quod uult deum</hi> excuſeth <hi>Tertullian</hi> in this maner, that by a body he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the ſubſtaunce, &amp; that whiche is in very dede, as though he therfore wrote that god is a body, leaſt he ſhould ſeme to deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is, foraſmuch as the vulgare people do thinke that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is vtterly nothing,<note place="margin">The nature of god is without a body.</note> which is not a body. Howbeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his boke <hi>de Geneſi ad littera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> in this maner reproueth him, that at ſometyme being ouercome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, he ſaid, That euery body is paſſible: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18396:127"/> leaſt he ſhould make god paſſible, he ought to haue denied him to be a body. Neither neded he ſo to bend himſelf to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> capacity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> therfore he ſhould pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce falſe things of god. For Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are not ſo to be inſtructed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like rude perſons (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futeth) they ſhould thinke that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which is not a body, but rather they ought ſo to be taught, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thinking of god they affirme nothing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out rules of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures. And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke <hi>de dogmate Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> we muſt attribute no more vnto it tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is mete. For it is aſcribed vnto <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but the learned beleue not that it is his.</p>
                  <p>The other thing, which is ſomtimes obiected, is an argument of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites.</hi> For they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for this cauſe we ought not to beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body, bycauſe the Scriptures teſtifie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man was made to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of God, which could not be true, except he haue a body as we haue. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image ſhould want y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimilitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wherunto it is referred. They thinke alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Scripture maketh with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when as it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times attributeth vnto god the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of men.<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> But <hi>Ierome</hi> (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Fortunatianus</hi> citeth him) wittely &amp; ſharpely deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If we ſhould leane vnto this reaſon (ſaith he) we ſhall eaſely proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man hath winges, bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture ſometimes aſcribeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to god, to whoſe image it is manifeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man was created. Theſe men ought rather dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to haue weighed that the image of God, conſiſteth in holineſſe, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; truth, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught. Whiche thyng if they had ſene, they had not only remoued a body from god, but they ſhould alſo haue led away their mindes from groſſer cogitations. Why do they not affirme that God is in very dede a beare, a Lion or fire, bycauſe ſo do <hi>Amos,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo the Epiſtle to the Hebrues call him? In the 95. <hi>Pſalme</hi> it is written: He that made the eye, ſhall he not ſee? he that made the eare, ſhall he not heare? <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith that there ſhould haue ben ſaid: he that made the eare, hath he not an eare? &amp; he that made the eye, hath he not an eye? But ſo it is not ſayd, leaſt in thinking of him,<note place="margin">Why the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth members vnto God.</note> thou ſhouldeſt be deceaued, &amp; ſuppoſe that he hath thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. But the holy ſcripture, if ſome tyme it attribute members vnto god, vndoubtedly this is the only cauſe, to helpe our infirmity, whereby althoughe we can not comprehend the eſſence of God as it is, yet in very dede it prouideth that by ſome certayne ſimboles and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes we may vnderſtande ſomewhat. Wherefore members are by a moſt profitable Metaphore attributed vnto God, that we diligently remembryng his proprietyes, might godlyly and faythfully exerciſe our myndes.<note place="margin">Why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned.</note> And the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites:</hi> if for that cauſe they had aſcribed members vnto God, as the Scriptures ſetteth them forth, to be a helpe vnto the weake vnderſtandyng of men: they myght be excuſed, neither ſhould they haue bene condemned. But they contended that the nature of God had ſo in very dede: wherefore iuſtly and worthely are they accuſed. But what ſhall we aunſwere to <hi>Paul,</hi> whiche of the ſeyng the nature of God in heauen, ſayth: We ſhall ſee him face to face, and by that meanes he ſemeth to graunt vnto our eyes and face the beholdyng of god, and after a ſorte to aſcribe vnto god himſelf a face?<note place="margin">There is a face of the body and a face of the mynde.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aunſwereth that there is a face alſo of the mynde, when as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that we nowe with a face vncouered do beholde thinges deuine, and not with a vayle put betwene, as the Iewes vſed when they talked with <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe thinges beyng thus finiſhed and concluded,<note place="margin">In the eternal life the bleſſed ſhall know the eſſence of God.</note> let vs in few wordes ſpeake of other kyndes of the knowledge of God.

The ſame thyng is gathered by the wordes of Chriſt: Their aungels alway beholde the face of the father, for in an other place he hath taught, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the bleſſed reſurrection the iuſt ſhalbe like the angels of god.

Wherfore in <hi>Iohn</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 6. chap: it is written: No man hath ſene god, but he which is of god, he hath ſene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. Alſo: As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father knoweth me, ſo know I y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. Wherfore this is onely geuen to Chriſt which is god, perfectly &amp; fully to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god.

I will not aunſwere to that, at this preſent. For in an other place, we ſhall haue occaſion geuen vs to ſpeake of the diuerſity or equality of rewardes in the bleſſed life.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we affirme of the ſtate of this life?

Howbeit theſe thinges are not to be vnderſtand as touchyng all maner of knowledge: for alſo whileſt we lyue here, it is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs after a ſort to know god. Wherfore theſe ſayings are to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (to ſpeake as the ſtoolemen do) of the ſubſtantiall &amp; eſſentiall knowledge of God.

                  <p>But beſides this naturall knowledge of god, this knowledge alſo offreth it ſelfe vnto vs, which conſiſteth of faith, &amp; is by the worde of god reueled vnto vs.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18396:128"/> But faith is not of vs (as to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> it is ſayd) but it is the gifte of God: for Chriſt alſo ſaith: No man can come vnto me except my father drawe him. Faith therfore aboundantly gathereth out of the holy ſcriptures y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of god, as much as ſufficeth to ſaluation, or as much as this our lyfe is able to receaue. Howbeit as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth this knowledge alſo is imperfect. For now we know hym by a glaſſe in a ſhadow &amp; but partly: &amp; althoughe in this knowledge we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte, whileſt we liue here, yet can we not atteyn to the knowledge of the eſſence of god. I know that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thought as touching <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Moſes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſometyme,<note place="margin">The opinion of Auguſtine, of Paul and Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes.</note> in minde whileſt they were here, they ſaw the ſubſtaunce of God: but I can not eaſely agree vnto it, foraſmuch as I iudge that thoſe places of <hi>Iohn,</hi> of the lawe, &amp; of <hi>Paul,</hi> which I before alledged, are moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Vnto which this may alſo be added, which is written in the 6. chap. of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Not that any man hath ſene the father: he which is of god, he ſeeth the father. And this is not to be paſſed ouer, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that which is here ſpoken of the father, is true alſo of the ſonne, as touchyng his deuine nature. Bycauſe, as I haue aboue declared, both out of <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the nature as wel of the Sonne, as of the Father is inuiſible. And it ſkilleth not if thou ſay, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, that they ſawe the nature and ſubſtaunce of God, not vſing the outwarde ſenſes but in a certayne traunſe or rauiſhing, or beyng alienated from the vſe of this lyfe. Theſe thinges are not gathered out of the Scriptures, yea contrarily we haue heard that <hi>Moſes</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyed the ſight of the face of God. Wherfore by the knowledge of fayth we both knowe God and his good will towarde vs, as much as is ſufficient to our true and perfect ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>But among all thoſe thinges, wherby out of the holy ſciptures we know god,<note place="margin">In Chriſt god is ſayd to be made viſible.</note> there is none more excellent than Chriſt himſelfe. Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> hath iuſtly ſayd: without controuerſye it is a great miſtery, God is made manifeſt in the fleſhe, &amp;c. The Lord alſo ſayth: <hi>Philip,</hi> he whiche ſeeth me, ſeeth alſo the father. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaid that he knew nothing els, but Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified. And vndoubtedly in Chriſt God may be ſayd to be made viſible: bycauſe he was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with man in the ſame ſelfe perſon. Wherfore they whiche ſawe Chriſt, might ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had ſene God. And he which by faith beholdeth and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth him, doth ſee far much more, than if he ſhould behold the burnyng buſhe of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Wherfore to the <hi>Colloſ.</hi> it is written, that in him are put all the treaſures of the wiſdome &amp; knowledge of god. And <hi>Iohn</hi> doth healthfully admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhe vs in his Epiſtle the 3. chap. as he which hath a hope to ſee God as he is, let him prepare himſelfe therunto, by purging himſelf, as he is pure &amp; cleane.

And for the moſt parte experience teacheth vs, that in darke places, &amp; where high trees grow, a certain admiration commeth vnto the mindes, by which admiration they applye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the more to the meditation of thinges deuine.

For there is nothing ſo vnder the power of the deuill, but that it may be turned to the glory and honour of god. Yet the godlye oughte not by this example to eate thinges offred vnto idoles, when they know that they are ſuche in dede. Not vndoubtedly, bcauſe the nature of that fleſh is chaunged, or ceaſeth to belonge vnto god, but bicauſe of the conſcience of the weake ones, and leaſte it ſhoulde ſeeme that we woulde be made pertakers of the table of the deuilles.

                  <p>IN the ende of the chapter twoo thinges are to be enquired of. The firſt is of miracles: the other is, how much or in what ſort it is lawful to require them.<note place="margin">The Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes.</note>
                  </p>

The Grecians call it <gap reason="foreign">

They cal them alſo <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia monſtra,</hi> and <hi>Portanta,</hi> that is wonders, monſters, and thinges ſeldom ſene, that we ſhould vnderſtand that God by theſe thinges wyl ſhewe that ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne thing ſhal come to paſſe or be done, contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon order of things aboue hope or expectation.<note place="margin">Miracles very muche renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> Wherfore ſeing mircales ar done aboue the natural courſe of thynges, they bring with them admiration. And vndoubtedlye there are verye many miracles, which by writers are made famous, as the temple of <hi>Diana in Epheſus.</hi> the Tombe of <hi>Artemiſia</hi> Queene of <hi>Caria,</hi> the horrible great image of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the walles of <hi>Babilon,</hi> &amp; very many other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſort.

                        <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> A general deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> chap. prudent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly writeth, I call a miracle whatſoeuer appeareth harde or vnaccuſtomed, aboue the hope or faculty of the wonderer. By which wordes, a certaine large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:18396:133"/> of miracles may be had.<note place="margin">Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ation is yll fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</note> And foraſmuch as it ſaid, that a miracle appeareth, they are worthely reproued which do fayne Tranſubſtantiation, and wyll haue it to be a miracle, which can neither be confirmed by the holy ſcriptures, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it appeareth not, neither can it be ſene, it cannot be called a myracle.</p>
                  <p>After this very common and large deſcription, ther is to be added, that of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles certaine are true,<note place="margin">Falſe miracles</note> and certaine are falſe. For thoſe are called falſe myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which either are not that which they ſeme to be, or els if they bee, they are not done by anye power, which paſſeth nature, but by the powers of nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſecrete. For Angels either good or bad may do them, and that thre maner of wayes. For ſometime they applye vnto matter the ſtrengthes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they perfectly know, of which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter wyth efficient cauſes, do follow effectes, &amp; ar in dede in a maner vpon the ſodaine, at the which the beholders cannot but maruayle. The deuils know that of thinges putrified are engendred Frogges, woormes, or ſome certaine Serpentes, ſo that heate in certaine degrees be added. Wherfore ſeing to them it is not hard to couple theſe thinges together, they do it ſomtimes to deceaue men with al. And by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinketh (as he writeth in his .3.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> booke <hi>de Trinitate</hi>) that the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers of <hi>Pharao</hi> did ſometimes the ſame thinges which <hi>Moſes</hi> dyd. Farther, the mouings of the ſpirites, of the blood and humours, doo verye much trouble the bodies of men: whereby figures, images, and ſhapes of thinges, whyche in them are kept, are in the ſame mocion brought before the phantaſy or imagination, &amp; by that maner and order, that the troubler of the ſpirite knitteth them. Wherof do ſpring ſundry and manifold ſightes, which we ſee doo ſometimes happen in ſuche as are in phrenſy. And the thing may come ſo farre, that the formes and images which are inwardly kept, may be called backe euen vnto the outwards ſenſes. Whereby, he which ſuffreth ſuch thinges, weeneth that he verilye ſeeth and feeleth thoſe thinges whiche are in his imagination or phanſye, and in hys ſenſe, when as in very dede there is no ſuche thing outwardlye done. And thys kinde of miracles ought rather to be referred to illuſions, then to miracles.</p>
                  <p>It alſo commeth to paſſe, that ſometimes theſe ſpirites by their own power, either of the ayre, or els other elements do forme certaine bodies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they appeare vtterly like mens bodies, and vnder them they appeare to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer they luſt. So came they ſometimes to <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> and other fathers. Theſe thinges (if we ſpeake properly and ſimply) ar not true miracles, but in our reaſon &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ther is nothing letteth, but that they may ſo be called. Yea and commonly Iuglers are ſaid to do miracles, when as for all that they deceaue by the nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of the handes, or by the powers of certaine thinges natural, do repreſent thinges wonderful to the beholders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are.</note>But this is the definition of true miracles. A miracle is a woorke hard and vnaccuſtomed, by the power of God, which paſſeth al faculty of nature created, to this ende wrought, to cauſe the beholders to wonder, and to confirme fayth towardes the woord of God.<note place="margin">Cauſes of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> Wherefore the matter of miracles are woorkes: and the forme is, that they be hard and vnaccuſtomed. The efficient cauſe, is the power of God, which ouercommeth nature created. And the end of them is both admiration and alſo confirmation of faith.</p>
                  <p>And that we ſhould not doubt of the efficient cauſe, this I thinke good to be added: That that power of God which vtterly is aboue the faculties of nature, is to be vnderſtande, ſometimes to woorke by it ſelfe, and other ſometimes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Aungels or by men, and that in ſuch maner as wee ſhall afterwarde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Farther, I wyll adde, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth in the place before alledged againſt the Epiſtle of the <hi>Maniches,</hi> the .xxvi. chap. Miracles woulde not mooue except they were wonderfull, and they would not be wonderful, if they ſhoulde be accuſtomed thinges. As therefore they ſay that by admiration ſprang Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, whych <hi>Plato</hi> thought to be the Raynebowe, and for that cauſe calleth the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18396:133"/> daughter of <hi>Thaumans,</hi> ſo may we beleue that faith,<note place="margin">Faithe cometh not of miracles but is by them confirmed.</note> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the worde of God, although it do not vtterly ſpring of miracles, yet by them it may be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed. And therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his .xii. booke of Confeſſions the .xxi. chap. ſaith: Ignorance is the mother of wondring at ſignes: this is an entraunce vnto faith to the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> which haue forgotten thee. By this ſentence he tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth that men which haue forget God, haue by the admiration of miracles an entrance or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto faith. And without doubt it is ſo. The wyll of God is hidden from vs: but he, as he is good, openeth the ſame to holy Prophets &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: which that they may profitably declare vnto men, he geueth vnto them the gift of his holy woord. But bicauſe he knoweth that mortal men are contrary &amp; againſt his word, he hath grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the power of working of miracles, that thoſe thinges might the eaſilier be beleued, which he would haue his meſſenger profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to ſpeake. That co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by miracles, <hi>Marke</hi> teſtifieth, who toward the end of his Goſpel ſaith: And they went forth, preaching euerye where, the Lord working with them, &amp; confirming the word with ſignes which followed. And how apt this kinde of confirmation is, hereby it is manifeſt. The promiſes of God do of no other thing depend, then of his wyll &amp; power. And the ſignes which we now intreate of, do teſtify the power of God, foraſmuch as they by al meanes ouercome nature, and ſet forth the truth of his wil: for by the inuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation of his name, &amp; by his grace &amp; ſpirit they are wrought.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Wherefore <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in the place now alledged againſt the Epiſtle of <hi>Manicheus</hi> writeth, that miracles do bring authority vnto the woord of God. For he, when he did theſe miracles, ſemed to haue geuen an earneſt peny of his promiſes. Neither ar theſe wordes to be paſſed ouer, which the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the .24.<note place="margin">Miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not in the greatnes of woorkes.</note> treatiſe. That miracles conſiſt not in the greatnes of workes: for otherwiſe it is a greater woorke to gouerne this vniuerſal compoſition of the world, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a blinde man to reſtore light, which he is deſtitute of.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thynges declared, there remayneth that by apt diſtinctions we deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute miracles into his partes. Some of them are to be wondred at,<note place="margin">An other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> by reaſon of the thing it ſelfe which is done, for that it is ſo vnaccuſtomed and great, that in the nature of thinges, we cannot finde the lyke of it. Suche was the ſtaying of the Sunne in the time of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and the turning of that ſhadowe in the tyme of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> the conception and byrth of the Virgin, the foode of Manna in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte, and ſuche lyke. But there are ſome which ar miracles, not for the nature and greatnes of the thing, but bycauſe of the maner and waye whiche was vſed in bringing them to paſſe, as was the cloude and rayne of <hi>Helias,</hi> the budding of floures and fruites in the rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the thunders of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the turnynge of water into wyne, and ſuche lyke: For ſuche thinges are done by nature, but they were then myracles, bycauſe of the maner whereby they were wrought, that is, not by naturall cauſes, but at the commaundement and wyll of Sayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</p>
                  <p>There is an other deuiſion of myracles,<note place="margin">An other deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of miracles</note> bycauſe ſome of them doo onelye mooue admiration, as lyghtenynges and thundrynges in mount <hi>Sina,</hi> the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſhadowe of the Sunne in the tyme of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> the tranſfiguration of the Lorde in the Mount. There are other, which beſides the admiration, doo bring a preſent commoditye vnto men, as when by the rodde, dryncke was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of the Rocke, Manna from heauen, and when by the Lord and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſycke folkes were healed. And ſometimes they bring puniſhment and hurt vnto the guiltye. For by the woordes of <hi>Peter</hi> periſhed <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limas</hi> the Sorcerer was made blynde by <hi>Paule:</hi> and ſome were by hym delyuered vnto Sathan to be vexed.</p>
                  <p>By this alſo are miracles deuided,<note place="margin">An other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of miracles.</note> bicauſe ſome of them are obtained by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For ſo did <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizeus,</hi> namelye by praying, reſtore their deade to lyfe.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:134"/> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo praying for <hi>Pharao,</hi> draue away Frogs and other plages. And other ſome are wrought by commaundement and authority. <hi>Ioſua</hi> commaunded the Sunne to ſtay his courſe. The Lord Ieſus commaunded the windes, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid vnto the lame man: In the name of Ieſus Chriſt riſe &amp; walke. Ther ar alſo other which are done neither by praiers, nor by commaundement, but of theyr own wyll and accord, the ſaintes them ſelues doing ſome other thing. Euen as when the ſhadow of <hi>Peter</hi> as he walked, healed thoſe that were ſycke, and the napkin of <hi>Paul</hi> healed alſo folkes diſeaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> An other diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of myracles.</note>Laſtly, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (as it is written in his .83. booke of queſtions, queſtion 79.) deuideth miracles, that ſome are done by publik iuſtice, that is, by the ſtable and firme will of God, which in the world is counted as a publike lawe. By it, God would that his miniſters, that is, Apoſtles and Prophetes, ſhoulde in preaching woorke miracles. And there are other ſome which by the ſignes of this iuſtice are wrought, as when the vngodly in the name of God or of Ieſus Chriſt do work any miracle, which is not geuen but by the honour and reuerence which thei vſe towardes the name of God: not that God, or nature, or any thinges created de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to gratefy them. As, when a man ſtealeth away a publike ſeale or handwri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he may wreſt many thinges, either from the men of the countrey, or from the Citizens which are not geuen vnto him, but vnto the ſeale which they know doth belong to the Magiſtrate and Prince: So he, which followed not Chriſte, did yet in his name caſt out deuils. Thirdly, are thoſe miracles reckoned, which by ſome certaine priuate bargaine are wrought, wherby the Sorcerers do binde them ſelues vnto the Deuyl, and the deuil likewiſe to them. But thoſe at done neither by publike iuſtice, nor yet by the ſignes therof, but come onelye of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne priuate conuention. Howbeit wee muſt knowe, that miracles of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third ſort are not firme, neither do they aſſuredly happen. For aſmuch as we reade in the .xix. chap. of the Actes of the Apoſtles, that the ſonnes of <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> would haue driuen out Deuils in the name of Ieſus, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, to whom the Deuil ſaid: Ieſus in deede &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> I know, but not you. Which when he had ſpoken,<note place="margin">Ciprian.</note> he inuaded them. And the ſame thing doth the act of <hi>Ciprian</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fy of the third kinde, before he was conuerted vnto Chriſt. For by magical artes he aſſayed to perſwade a godly virgin to his filthy pleaſure: which thing at the laſt the Deuil confeſſed that he could not performe vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit we muſt marke, that theſe miracles which are by a priuate contract done,<note place="margin">Thei be not mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles in deede which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil woorketh.</note> are not in very dede miracles, but pertaine onely to thoſe which we made mencion of before the definition: for although ſometimes they bee that in verye dede which they ſeme for, yet are they not true miracles. For who doubteth, but that it was true fyre, wherwith the Cattel of <hi>Iob</hi> were burnt? and a true blaſt of winde, wherwith his houſe being throwen downe, his children were ſlayne? Yea and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth that the Serpents which the Sorcerers brought forth were not illuſions,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> but true Serpentes in dede. For the hiſtory ſayth, that when they came vnto the third ſigne, the Sorcerers ſayde: This is the finger of God, and they teſtified that now their cunning failed them, &amp; that they could no more do thoſe things which <hi>Moſes</hi> by the power of God did. And that is a token that they wrought not before by illuſions, &amp; that the Sorcerers euen tyll that time contended with <hi>Moſes</hi> in things in dede, &amp; not in illuſions. But ſome wil ſay:<note place="margin">Whiche ſignes ſay: of Antichriſt ar called lyes.</note> If the matter be thus, that the thinges which are done by the diuell &amp; Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, be in very dede that which they ſeme for: why is it vnto the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> of Antechriſt written, that by him very many ſhould be deceaued by falſe ſignes &amp; wonders? We muſt ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lye ought not to be referred to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is to bee done, but vnto the miracle. For although the thinges which are done, ſhal ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times be the ſame things in dede which they ſeme to be, yet ſhal they not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, although they ſeme ſo. But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth. Signes &amp; wonders ar called lies, either bicauſe they appeare, &amp; are not in dede, or els bicauſe they leade
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18396:134"/> men to lyes. For Antechriſt by thoſe ſignes ſhall ſeeke nothing els, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue and allure men to beleue falſe thinges. That is no newe or vnaccuſtomed thing, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe ſhould by his effect obtain his name or propriety. But in that they appeare and are not, it may be two maner waies vnderſtand: either bicauſe among true thinges ſome illuſions are mingled: or els bicauſe thei are ſet forth for miracles, when as they are no miracles in deede.</p>
                  <p>There is an other doubt to be diſſolued, how that power of God, whiche paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth nature, vſeth either Angels or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as wel good as euil, to worke miracles. He vſeth them as certaine inſtrumentes, &amp; ſometimes he doth miracles at their deſire, prayers, and commaundement, without any of their outwarde woorke. And ſometimes he wyl haue them, to adde ſome woorke or maiſtrye of theirs. For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmote the ſea, and the rock with his rod. Chriſt touched the leprous, and anointed the eyes of the blinde. But we muſt vnderſtande that there is two kindes of inſtrumentes. Some are ſo ordained, that althoughe they are not the principal cauſes efficient, yet do they very much profite, for the bringing foorth of the effect, as is pron to cut hard thinges, and medicines to heale, when as for all that they are inſtrumentes of the woorkemen.<note place="margin">What ſtrength inſtruments of God haue in do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing hys mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> But God in woorking mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles vſeth an other kinde of inſtrument, namely, which of their own nature haue no ſtrength to bring forth the effect. For what good could the rod do to open the ſea? What could the ſhadow of <hi>Peter</hi> helpe to heale the ſicke? Vndoubtedly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if thou looke vpon nature it ſelfe. The inſtrumentes therefore which god vſeth in theſe miracles, do of their own nature either nothing helpe vnto them, or rather ſometimes let them, as the beholding of the braſen Serpent, the ſalt of <hi>Helizeus,</hi> the water of <hi>Elias,</hi> which he poured on the burnt offering, and the clay which Chriſt put to the eyes of the blinde. Wherfore, when miracles are done by inſtrumentes of this kinde which nothing helpe, yea rather do let the might and power of God, is much more apparantly illuſtrated.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt alſo to teache that natural ſtrength ſeemeth nothing hereunto, at the mariage ſayd vnto his mother: What haue I to doo with thee O woman? Not that he woulde in that thing derogate the authoritye of his mother, but that it might manifeſtly appeare, that the nature which hee tooke of her, was by hys own power, nothing able to woorke miracles. Wherefore,<note place="margin">God vſeth both good and euyll, aſwel me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels, to woorke miracles.</note> foraſmuche as God for the working of miracles vſeth men and Angels, and thoſe as well good as euyl, and ſometimes thoſe miracles are benefites, and ſometimes puniſhments, wherewith men are either puniſhed or holpen, we muſt not doubt whether God do ſometimes puniſh by good Angels. For it is very manyfeſt that Sodome was ouerthrowne by Angels, the hoſt of <hi>Senacherib</hi> ſlayne by an Angell, and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw the Angel which was the miniſter of the peſtilence of the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon the .78.<note place="margin">Whither God doth by angels directlye helpe.</note> Pſalme doubteth whither God by euyll Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels hath wrought miracles, whereby men wer immediatly endued with ſome benefite. And he faith, that he hath not red it in the holy ſcriptures: neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly haue I red it. Vnleſſe we wyl ſay, that at the length it profited <hi>Paule,</hi> that he was vexed by the angel of Sathan. And that for that cauſe ſome wer by him deliuered vnto Sathan, that their ſpirite in the day of the Lord might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued. But the queſtion of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tendeth not to this, but whither perfect and manifeſt benefites, as reſtoringes to health, prophecies, giftes of tonges, foode, deliuerye, and ſuche like, are of God ſometimes by the Deuill geuen vnto holye men by ſome certayne miracle: I thinke herein as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thincketh, that the ſame is no where teſtified in the holy ſcriptures. But that by euyll Angels, as wel the godly as the vngodly are tempted, puniſhed &amp; vexed, it is euident. But after a diuers ſorte,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> bicauſe (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the ſame place affirmeth) there are after a ſorte two flockes of men, namely one of the wicked, and an other of the good. The good are the flocke of God: euen as the wycked are the flocke of the Deuyll: wherefore towardes them he woorketh more frely as toward his own,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:135"/> he vexeth, mocketh, and handleth them yll, as by hys owne ryght. And yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them can he not do any thing beyonde the meaſure preſcribed of God. But againſt the flocke of God he dareth do thing, but ſo much as God himſelfe wyll ſomtime permit him, as we reade was done of <hi>Iob.</hi> God ſometime ſuffreth the ſayntes to be greuouſly afflicted of Sathan, to the ende his grace towardes them may moſt manifeſtly be declared.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Whither the plagues of the Egiptians wer done by good Aungels or by euyll.</note>But when <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expoundeth theſe wordes of the Pſalme: namelye, the ſending out of euyll Angels, he doubteth whither the plagues of the <hi>Egiptians</hi> were done by a good Angel or by the Deuyl. And at the length he ſheweth, that the plague and deſtruction of the firſt begotten maye be aſcribed vnto the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Deuyl: but the other plagues are to be attributed vnto good angels, that the ſentence both of the booke of <hi>Exodus</hi> and of the Pſalme may ſtand faſt. Howbeit, as touching that plage of the firſte begotten, in <hi>Exodus</hi> it is written vnder the name of God: I wil this night paſſe through Egipt, and wil ſmite. &amp;c By theſe woordes that deſtruction ſemeth to be aſcribed, eyther vnto god, or to a good Angel, and not vnto the Deuil. But that moueth me not much, bycauſe although it were done by the miniſtery of the Deuil, yet maye it be aſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde. For <hi>Iob,</hi> when by the woorke of the Deuil he was bereft bothe of goodes and children, ſaid neuertheleſſe: The Lorde hath geuen, and the Lorde hath taken away, and that (ſayd he) was done by the Lorde, which was done by the Deuil. But ſome obiect: If we aſſigne theſe things vnto the Deuil, then ſhal he ſeme to haue fought againſt himſelf. For the Sorcerers, by the help of deuils, withſtoode <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they did the ſame thinges that he dyd. And if plagues were by euyl Angels ſent againſt the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> and the Sorcerers went about to withſtand them, then Sathan ſemed to reſiſt Sathan. Neither could the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers haue trulye ſayde that they fayled, and teſtified that it was the fynger of God whych wrought. But theſe reaſons in my iudgement are not ſtrong, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thinges done by the Sorcerers, were done by the power of Sathan, which is vnto him naturall. For by it he is able to applye the ſeedes of thynges and woorking cauſes to his matter prepared, and to woorke wonders as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſight of man. But thoſe thinges, wherewith God afflicted the <hi>Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> were by his moſt mighty power wrought by the inſtrument of the Deuyll. Wherefore it is no maruail if the Sorcerers failed, and felt the moſt excellent power of the finger of God.</p>

And in the .xvii. chap. it is written, that the <hi>Egiptians</hi> being among thoſe plagues, eſpecially when they were oppreſſed with darknes, wer with horrible vexations of minde, and ſights very terrible ſo vexed, as though moſt doleful ſpirites had perpetuallye bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and about their phantaſy: which vndoubtedly might be done by the ſending of euyl Angels, as the Pſalme doth mencion.

That lawe hath he made, not for himſelf, but for men, that they ſhould frame theyr life after it. Wherfore it was to him lawful to require of <hi>Abraham</hi> the immolation of his ſonne, which thing none of vs can require of our frend. <hi>Paule</hi> and other Apoſtles had euill ſprites ſubiect vnto them, and by them it was ſometimes lawfull vnto them, to puniſh the guilty for theyr ſaluation: Wherefore thoſe to whome ſuch a gift is not graunted ought to abſtayne from excerciſing the ſame.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:136"/>
                  <p>I thinke it good nowe to returne to examine the laſte parte of our difinicion, wherin it was ſayd, that miracles are therfore done to eſtabliſh fayth. And that ſeemeth to be very much againſt this particle, that we ought not lightly to geue credite vnto miracles, foraſmuch as they may ſhew occaſion of erring. And ther hence is deriued no ſure kind of argument, but an argument very daungerous. And that is proued by manye places. Firſt the Lorde ſayth in the .24. chapter of Math. that the falſe prophetes in the latter time ſhall by ſygnes ſo deceiue men, that if it were poſſible euen the very electe ſhould be deceiued, which ſelfe ſame ſentence <hi>Paul</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Theſſal.</hi> more amply proſecuted. By the boke of <hi>Exodus</hi> alſo we learne that we may not beleue ſignes. For the ſorcerers of <hi>Pharao</hi> did for a little ſpace worke the ſame ſignes which <hi>Moſes</hi> did. In <hi>Deutr.</hi> alſo it is commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded that we muſt not beleue a prophet, although he worke ſignes, if he moue vs to idolatry. Wherfore ſeing miracles may be wrought, aſwel for the defending of falſe doctrine,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> as for true, they ought not to be counted mete to confirm faith. Yea and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 10. boke <hi>de ciuitate dei</hi> the .16. chapt. writeth: If au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels require ſacrifices to be offred vnto them, and worke ſignes: and contrarywiſe, if other ſhall teſtify that we muſt ſacrifice onely vnto God, and yet working no miracles: we muſt beleue them and not the other. The ſame <hi>Auguſtine contra Fauſtum de Manichaeis</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">Miracles ar not ſufficient to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm faith.</note> Signes ye worke none, wherby we ſhould beleue you, yea and although ye ſhoulde woorke them, yet ſhoulde wee not beleue you. Wherfore we muſt know that miracles in very deede are not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme fayth: for it is before all thinges nedefull to iudge of that doctrine, whiche is brought: and that by the teſtimony of the holy ſcriptures, wherewith if it do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, we muſt beleue it euen without ſignes. But if miracles be added, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers are ſtill the more eſtabliſhed: and they whiche yet haue not beleued, are made at the leaſt more attentife, and the way to beleue is opened vnto them</p>

Both of them ſerue to confyrme faythe, but neither of them are ſufficient by themſelues. For they are bleſſed, and to be prayſed in dede, which beleue without the helpe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Our Lord ſayth: Bleſſed ar they which haue not ſene, and haue beleued. And yet for all that the confyrmation of ſignes is not to be contemned.<note place="margin">Why the lorde ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad that his mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles ſhould be publiſhed.</note> Parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture thou wilt ſay: Seing they are ſo profitable to confyrme fayth, why did the Lorde in <hi>Math.</hi> the .9. and .11. and in manye other places forbidde that they ſhoulde be publiſhed? There were many cauſes thereof, he woulde firſte haue his doctrine preached, and afterward miracles ſhoulde followe. But if he had permitted certayne whome he healed, ſtrayghtwaye to haue publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroade that which he had done, then ſhould not doctrine haue bene ioyned with that ſpreading abroade of the miracle, foraſmuch as they were not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in godlynes. He did it alſo, leaſt he ſhoulde ſeeme to be infected with-vayne deſyre of worldly glory. Therefore he would by hys own example with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs from the ſame. Farther none knew better then himſelf, what they wer whome he healed. And he woulde not ſuffer euerye one to publiſhe and preache his miracles. Wherfore he prohibited diuers, that they ſhould not do it. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he ſaw that by the vayne and naked preachinge of miracles, it woulde come to paſſe, that the light and fickle vulgare people ſhoulde not be led vnto the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere fayth, but rather to appoynte vnto him worldly honours, which he coueted not. And this to be true the .6. chap. of Iohn declareth, where it is written, that the people bicauſe they receaued breade of him, woulde haue made him a kinge. Laſtly, he would not ſtirre vp agaynſt himſelf the enuy and woodnes of the high Prieſtes, Scribes, and Phareſies more then oportunity of time woulde ſuffer.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18396:136"/> Wherfore in <hi>Luke</hi> the .9. chap. when in hys tranſfiguracion he had ſhewed vnto his Apoſtles a ſhew of his glory, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould not at that time publiſhe abrode that which they had ſeene.

For they wer not then ſo confirmed, that if they had ſpread ſuch things abroad, they could in diſputing haue confirmed the ſame by apt teſtimonies. Wherfore he thought meete that they ſhoulde tary till they were more fully inſtructed. He would not haue the truth vtterly to be vnſpoken of, but yet to the openinge of the ſame, he choſe a time conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Wherfore it is not therby rightly gathered that myracles are of no force to confirme fayth, bycauſe Chriſt ſometimes forbad that they ſhould be publiſhed, foraſmuch as that commaundement of the Lorde belonged onely for the taking of better occaſions, and not perpetually to keepe ſilence.

For in <hi>Math.</hi> the 13. chapter it is written, that Chriſte, bicauſe of the incredulitye of his owne citizens, wroughte in a manner no miracles. And <hi>Marke</hi> addeth, that he could not. Wherfore it ſhuld ſeme that it is rather to be ſaid, that miracles ar conſtituted and ſtabliſhed by fayth, when as if it be not preſent (as the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes ſay) miracles can not be done. I aunſwere, that they which by prayers will obtayn miracles, muſt after an accuſtomed &amp; iuſt maner be endewed with faith: for vayne are thoſe prayers counted which leane not vnto fayth. But if a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle be geuen, there is nothing letteth, but that fayth whiche is begon, maye by it be ſtirred vp &amp; confyrmed. Farther this is for aſſured, that god is not letted, but that he can alſo geue miracles vnto the vnbeleuers,<note place="margin">God ſometime geueth mira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles vnto the vnbeleuers.</note> yea he hath oftentimes geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miracles vnto them. Vndoubtedly <hi>Pharao</hi> and the <hi>Egiptians</hi> were infidels. And who knoweth not but that there were vnto them very many miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes?</hi> Chriſt likewiſe did then ſhew the miracle of his reſurrection, when all men in a manner diſpayred of his doctrine and truth. Wherfore nothing letteth but that faith may by miracles be confirmed. And for that cauſe as we haue ſaid, they which contend by prayers to obteyne ſignes, do labour in vayn, except they beleue. Bicauſe prayers without fayth are of no value wyth God, which Chriſt hath manifeſtly taught in <hi>Math.</hi> the .17. For when his diſciples could not heale the lunatike child, when the cauſe thereof was demaunded, he ſayd, that it came of theyr incredulity: whoſe aunſwere openly declareth,<note place="margin">Againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iurations wich are made al the ſepulchres or graues of the deade.</note> what we muſte iudge of thoſe cuniurers, which at the ſepulchers of ſaincts and at reliques, go about to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell deuels.

But that is more manifeſtly perceaued by the ſame epiſtle, wher the Apoſtle maketh mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fre gratious gifts, ſaying: to ſome is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of wiſedome, to other the word of knowledge, to ſome the power to heale, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome fayth in the ſame ſpirite &amp;c.

For it is not rekened among giftes, which ar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately diſtributed to ſome, but is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all true Chriſtians. Now as I think it appeareth, by what meanes they whiche are not iuſtified by theyr prayers, doo ſometimes obtayne miracles, namely bycauſe they ar not deſtitute of euery kind of faith.

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:18396:137"/>
                  <p>Vnto the queſtion I anſwere: That after a ſort it is lawful to deſire ſignes, and the ſame alſo after a ſorte is vnlawfull. The firſt parte of the ſentence is thus proued: When holy men deſire, as touching any vnaccuſtomed vocation to be made more aſſured of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of God, &amp; are afrayd, leaſt peraduenture they ſhould be deceaued (for as concerning it they haue nothing for certayn in the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and we muſt not lightly beleue men and angels in thoſe thinges: for euil angels vſe ſometimes to be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformed into angels of light) when I ſay they are troubled with ſuch doubt, &amp; the will is ready, yea deſirous to obey the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord, if than they deſire to be confirmed by ſome ſigne, theſe godly men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be accuſed of tempting of god, or of raſhnes. For who ſoeuer in thoſe caſes deſireth thoſe thinges, whiche god vſeth to offer, he departeth not from the right way. No man is ignoraunt, but that to <hi>Achab</hi> was offred a ſigne, that he might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed of the promiſes offred him by <hi>Eſay.</hi> Wherfore to deſire thoſe thinges whiche god ſometymes geueth and frely offreth, ought not to be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited as vnlawfull. The thing wanteth no examples. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he had nede of the helpe of god, oftentymes in the deſert obteyned miracles for the people of god. And to confirme the doctrine of truth, both <hi>Helias</hi> and <hi>Helizeus,</hi> deſired of god that life might be reſtored vnto the children of their hoſtes. And to the ſame end Chriſt ſayd: But that ye ſhould know that the ſonne of man hath power to forgeue ſinnes, he turned to the man ſicke of the palſey and ſayd:<note place="margin">For what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes godly men may deſire mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> Take vp thy bed, riſe and walke. Wherfore miracles are deſired of holy men, and that iuſtly, either that they may be made the more aſſured of their vocation, or to helpe a great and vrgent neceſſity, or els to beare witneſſe vnto ſound doctrine. And alwayes, when they deſire miracles to theſe endes,<note place="margin">Cautions in de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiring of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> let them deſire the ſame not of any creatures, but of god onely, and in aſking them let them vſe a meane: for they declare that they will or deſire nothyng, but that whiche is agreable vnto the will of god.</p>
                  <p>Nowe on the contrary parte let vs conſider after what maner miracles are vnworthely and vniuſtly deſired. Firſt there are ſome,<note place="margin">When it is not lawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire miracles.</note> whiche therfore deſire miracles, bicauſe they are not wel perſuaded of the power, goodneſſe and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of god, neither ſeeke they any thing els, but to haue a trial of thoſe things. Neither are they contente with the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly and amply teache all theſe thinges. Wherefore iuſtly are they to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for aſmuch as they be ready rather to beleue miracles, than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god. Wherfore <hi>Abraham</hi> aunſwered vnto that riche man whiche was tormented in flames of fire, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deſired that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent vnto his brethren, that they alſo ſhould not be thruſt downe into the ſame puniſhementes: They haue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophetes. By which wordes is manifeſtly declared, that we muſt rather beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miracles. There ar other alſo, which for this cauſe deſire miracles, that they may liue more pleaſauntly as touching the fleſh, and to ſatiſfie their wicked luſtes. Of which faulte the Hebrues are accuſed, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the deſerte, when very great aboundance of <hi>Manna</hi> was miniſtred vnto them, they deſired fleſhe, that they might lyue the more pleaſauntly in that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe. Laſtly, ſome deſire miracles for this entent, to ſatiſfie theyr vayne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. For (as <hi>Plinius</hi> hath ſayd) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is moſt gredy of new things.<note place="margin">Plinius.</note> Wherfore they ſeme to deſire miracles as playes and paſſetymes to ſporte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues withal. In that maner looked <hi>Herode</hi> for miracles of Chriſt: for when he was brought vnto him, he deſired to fede and delite his curioſity with miracles. Nowe I ſuppoſe it is manifeſt, how it is forbidden to deſire ſignes, and howe it is lawfull ſometymes to deſire them.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt we diſſolue theſe thinges,<note place="margin">An anſwere to obiections. What it is to tempt god.</note> which ſemed to be agaynſt thoſe thinges that we haue ſpoken. They which by the waye and maner already deſcribed do deſire miracles, do not without doubt tempt God: foraſmuch as that is nothing els, than of an vnbeleuing minde, and of raſhneſſe, to deſire a triall of hys will
<pb facs="tcp:18396:138"/> and power, whiche vice certainely is in the holy Scriptures iuſtly and worthily reproued. Wherfore, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, did not without iuſt cauſe reproue the deuil, when he would haue led him to haue throwen himſelf hedlong from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple, whereby he myght be made the more aſſured of the beneuolence of God towardes him, when that by arte there was a playne way to diſcende by. The ſame ſonne of god alſo did not vnworthily reprehend the Iewes as a frowarde and adulterous generation, vnto whom he therfore denied a ſigne, bycauſe they had already ſene very many, yet they ſpoke euill of them al, and mocked Chriſt, in ſuch ſorte that they deſired not euery kinde of miracle, but one from heauen, as thoughe they would not alſo deride ſignes from heauen: vndoubtedly theyr purpoſe tended to no other end, but to alienate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people from the Lord, although he had wrought wonderfull miracles. And as touching <hi>Achaz</hi> the wicked king, I ſhall not nede to ſtande long about him: for he fayned that when he was called of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet, he did very faithfully beleue, as thoughe he neded no miracle, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as for all that he was altogether vnbeleuing, whiche the 2. booke of kinges mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſtly declareth: for he ſent vnto <hi>Tiglathphalaſar</hi> the king of the <hi>Aſsirians,</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him from the ſiege, ſo farre was he of from putting confidence in the Lord. And when God was not ignoraunt of his diſceaſe, he offred vnto hym the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a miracle, and gaue him his choiſe, whiche for all that he of hypocriſie refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.<note place="margin">Obedience is the principall fruite of faith.</note> If <hi>Achaz</hi> had in very dede beleue god, he would not haue refuſed to obey, for aſmuch as obedience is reckened among the principall fruites of faith.</p>
                  <p>Let vs (I pray you) with this wicked kyng conferre his moſt holy ſonne <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias.</hi> For he did not ſo, but to the end he myght be made the more aſſured of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering health, he very modeſtly required a ſigne: vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when <hi>Eſay</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted his deſire, willi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g him to chuſe whether he would haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhadow of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſunne to be remoued forward, or turned backward, he tooke his choiſe, neither did he frowardly like his father w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracle offred him by god. But wicked <hi>Achaz</hi> added hipocriſie vnto infidelitie. For he conſidering that miracles are for two cauſes refuſed, either for that a man beleueth fully in god, neither hath nede of the ayde of miracles, or els for that he vtterly contemneth god, and paſſeth no thing at al of his aide, he would hide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latter diſeaſe wherof he was ſicke, namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of god: &amp; he diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled vertue, wherof he was cleane voyde, namely a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular faith, as though he durſt not tempt God. But for aſmuch as God moſt per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectly knoweth the hart and the raynes, he reproued hym by the Prophete accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſerte. What other thing is it to refuſe a miracle offred of God, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repell the ſuccor of the ſpirituall infirmitie? As he that is hunger ſtoruen is to be accuſed if the refuſe bread: ſo was he to be reproued, which reiected a medicine offred hym by god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he knoweth, what euery one of vs nedeth, far better than we our ſelues can ſee. This is nowe ſufficient as touching theſe things, whiche at the begynning of the queſtion ſemed altogether to forbidde the aſkyng of miracles.</p>
                  <p>I know in dede there are ſome whiche thinke that miracles are vtterly not to be deſired:<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> but onely not to be refuſed when God offreth them. And they thinke that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maketh with them, whom (in his 4. booke <hi>de Conſenſu Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt.</hi> and in his queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <hi>ſuper Geneſin.</hi> Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 63) ſemeth to affirme thys thing. But if thou wilt obiect, that very many godly &amp; holy men did it, and eſpecially our <hi>Gideon:</hi> they anſwere, that they were moued by the ſpirite of God to deſire miracles: and therfore it was all one, as if God had frely offred ſignes vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they of obedience ſhoulde haue receaued the miracles whiche were offered. But theſe things ought nothing to trouble vs, bycauſe <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the places alledged, doth not abſolutly and ſimply prohibet to deſire miracles, except they be deſired to tempte god withall, or vpon ſome noughty occaſion. Yea in the 63. queſtion vpon <hi>Geneſis</hi> he ſayth: When this is not rightly done, it pertayneth to the tempting of god. Let vs heare him rather in his 10. boke of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions the 35.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18396:138"/> chap. where he ſayeth: In religion alſo is temptyng of god, when ſignes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are deſired, to take a triall: Whiche thyng I alſo a litle before haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be taken hede of. And I will eaſely graunt that the Sainctes required not miracles by the inſtinct of the fleſhe, or prouokyng of humane reaſon: other wiſe their prayers had ben voyde and of none effect, for that (as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth) it behoueth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite do with vnſpeakable groning pray for vs. But I thinke I haue now ſufficiently ſpoken of the queſtions propoſed.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 And the Lord ſayd vnto Gideo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The people that are with thee, are to many for me to geue the Madianites into theyr handes, leaſt Iſraell make theyr vaunt agaynſt me, and ſay: myne owne hand hath ſaued me.</p>

                  <p>As much as we can gather by the hiſtory, the hoſt of <hi>Gideon</hi> conſiſted of 32000. ſouldiers: whiche nomber although it may ſeme great, yet in compariſon of the enemies it was but ſmall. For they had 13500. men in campe, but of the 32000. ſouldiers of <hi>Gideons,</hi> god choſe onely 300, by whom he would geue the victory vnto the Iſraelites. This is a very ſmal number, that of euery thouſand he toke only .x. But ſo god wrought. For there ar few good, ſaid he. If in <hi>Sodome</hi> there had ben onely x. men iuſt, the whole Citie had ben ſaued. The number of good men, thoughe it be ſmall, yet it is of ſuch force, that God for their ſakes ſpareth the reſt. Wherfore moſt true are the oracles, wherin it is ſayd: Many are called, but few are choſen, and the remnauntes onely ſhalbe ſaued. But although God
<pb facs="tcp:18396:139"/> allowed not ſo great a number, yet the acte of <hi>Gideon</hi> is not to be condemned, which gathered it vnto himſelf: for he vſed that prudence, which was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the worde of god: yea if he had not collected an hoſt, he might haue ſemed to tempt god, as he which had refuſed helpes prepared, and thoſe iuſt helpes. Let vs remember that in humane actions there ar two notable daungers: One is of raſheneſſe,<note place="margin">Two verye great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers in humane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> when we will not vſe meanes and helpes ſet before vs. With which euill the Anabaptiſtes are greuouſly infected: for they will vſe no weapons, and they abhorre from the offices of Magiſtrates.

Of theſe two daungers the one <hi>Gideon</hi> by himſelfe auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in collecting a ſufficient great army: for in his enterpriſe he would not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect an ordinary ayde of ſouldiers.

Therfore he ſayth that his will is, that euen as the victory ſhould be geuen by hym, ſo alſo it ſhould euidently appeare, to be graunted by hym.</p>
                  <p>

God alſo fedeth vs, euen then when all thinges are aboundant and good cheape: but that is not ſo well perceaued, as when a great multitude is refreſhed with foure or fiue loaues. And vndoubtedlye it is the power of God, when the goſpel is defended and ſpread abrode by men very well learned and princes moſt ſtout. But it is not then ſo euident as when it is ſowed by idiotes &amp; power men, and that with great fruite, &amp; incredible felicitie. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd: Brethren ſee to your vocation: not many noble men, not many mighty men, not many wiſe men are called, but god hath choſen the fooliſh, weake, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned things of the world, bycauſe he would not haue the Croſſe of Chriſt and the power ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of abrogated, but manifeſtly to appeare, that euen as <hi>Ieremy</hi> commaunded, the ſtrong man ſhould not glory in his ſtrength, nor the riche man in his riches, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wiſe man in his wiſedome.

And howe great a ſtrength we haue nede in profeſſing of Chriſt, the wordes of <hi>Paul</hi> do manifeſtly declare, wherein he ſayth: All they whiche will lyue godlyly in Chriſt Ieſu, muſt ſuffer perſecution. The ſame thyng alſo teſtifieth he, ſaying: Our battayle is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt fleſhe and bloud, but agaynſt wicked ſpirites whiche dwell in the ayre.

Wherefore the ſeconde tyme they are brought vnto the water, where yet the ſluggiſhe are ſeparated, which will not drinke, but bowing themſelues on their knees. Thoſe are they whiche pamper themſelues, they can abyde no ſorowe, and they are quickly ouercome. There were onely 300. whiche dranke with reaching their hande vnto their mouth, &amp; they alone were ioyned vnto <hi>Gideon.</hi> Here may we ſe, how god with drew fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Gideon</hi> his captayne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes aydes, not vndoubtedly to betray him, but therby to geue him a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victory. Wherfore when helpes of nature are taken away, then muſt ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of fayth remayne, wherewith we muſte no leſſe followe our vocation, then if they were preſent. Whiche thynge very many doo not, whiche ſtrayght waye as ſoone as they ſee themſelues deſtitute of humane helpes, they byd al pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine farewell: when as for all that they ought to remember, that the power of God, whereby the blynde are made to ſee, the dead made a lyue, and the poore, bleſſed, nothyng dependeth of worldly helpes.</p>
                  <p>Concernyng the wordes of the hiſtorye two thynges are to be noted. The firſte is, that the fearefull are commaunded to returne vnto <hi>Gilead,</hi> whiche ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to be agreable vnto the place where they were. For they were not on this ſyde <hi>Iordane,</hi> where mount <hi>Gilead</hi> laye in the tribe of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely I ſaye of <hi>Machir,</hi> but they were come into the lande of <hi>Chanaan</hi> beyonde <hi>Iordane.</hi> Wherefore we muſte ſaye, that either there were two mountes ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: or that that whiche is written of mounte <hi>Gilead,</hi> is to be referred vnto the begynnyng of thoſe whiche departed awaye: as thoughe it ſhould haue ben ſayd, that they were ſent awaye, whiche were borne in mounte <hi>Gilead.</hi> Theſe thinges doo certayne interpretors write, whiche whether they be true or falſe, it is not certayne. For we are ignoraunt whether <hi>Gideon</hi> with his hoſt paſſed ouer <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane</hi> or no. Farther we muſt note that thys worde <hi>Tſerath</hi> ſignifieth to purge: whereby the Hiſtorye ſheweth, that the hoſte ſhoulde be purged of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were diſmiſſed, bycauſe (as I aboue mencioned) there were none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from that multitude of Souldiers, but ſuche as were vnwoorthy. Wherefore they coulde not iuſtly complayne of the iuſtice of God.<note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> I very much meruayle of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> whiche affirmeth that God woulde haue none to go forth
<pb facs="tcp:18396:140"/> with <hi>Gideon,</hi> but ſuch as were fearefull, that therby the victorye myght be the more noble, and referred to be receaued onely of God. And he ſayth, that they which bowed their knees and dranke, were valiant men, and truſted to much in their owne ſtrength. And for that they nothing paſſed vpon their enemyes, they kneled downe without any feare and dranke: but they which ſtoode and reached theyr handes to theyr mouth and lapped water out of them, thoſe ſayth he were of a cowardiſhe minde, as they whiche for feare of their enemyes durſt not frely euen drinke. But this fayned thing very much diſagreeth with the hiſtory, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commaunded to be proclaymed by expreſſe wordes, that the fearefull ſhould depart, and he would haue hys precept obſerued whiche he gaue in <hi>Deut.</hi> Wherefore it ſemeth not that he would adioyne timetous folkes vnto <hi>Gideon.</hi> But <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in hys narration omitteth the commaundement that the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhould be diſmiſſed, either bycauſe it was out of his memory, or els for what other cauſe I can not tell.</p>

We deſerue aſſuredly for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy (I wil not ſay infidelity) vtterly to be abiected: but the heauenly father, as he is good, breaketh not a bruſed rede, and que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cheth not ſmoking flaxe, which we now ſee in <hi>Gideon.</hi> He ſendeth him to the hoſt of his enemies to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, and he vſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Madianites,</hi> the enemies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites for an oracle. And it is not maruelous: for if in the old time he vſed wood &amp; gold in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tabernacle, at the arke, I ſay, &amp; mercy ſeate, to geue anſwers, what ſhould let but that he may vſe men alſo vnto that office? And without doubt the beginning of the victory was,<note place="margin">The beginning of a victorye, is to knowe the feare of the ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes.</note> to manifeſt vnto <hi>Gideon</hi> the feare of his enemyes. For in warfare nothing more profiteth, then to know the feare of the enemyes: and to knowe the ſame at the length for aſſured, very much pertayneth to warlike pollecies.</p>
                  <p>And in manifeſtyng of it, God obſerueth his olde accuſtomed manner.

Wherfore when <hi>Gideon</hi> heard euen of his enemyes how they wer affected, he doubted not of the ſucceſſe of the battayle. Here is ſet forth a notable example of obedience. For <hi>Gideon</hi> was deadly hated of the <hi>Madianites,</hi> bycauſe he had now collected an hoſt agaynſt them, and yet beyng commaunded to go to their tentes he obeyed. And if he had ben afrayde, there was no other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion graunted him, then <hi>Purah</hi> his lad.

                  <p>Hereby alſo may we learne,<note place="margin">Vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſometimes are geuen true dreames and the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of them.</note> that dreames of prophecieng are by God geuen vnto enemies of godlyneſſe, and to that nation, which afflicted the holy people &amp; the Churche: and this is not the firſt tyme.

As touchyng the firſte, <hi>Ariſtotle, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galene,</hi> alſo other famous Philoſophers haue written many things, and amongeſt them <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his litle booke <hi>de Diuinatione per Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> (if ſo it be his booke, althoughe we can not doubt but that it is wytty and learned) ſayeth firſt, that this kynde of diuination ſemeth not vtterly to be abie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, bycauſe of the common ſorte very much is attributed vnto it: and thoſe thynges whiche are commonly receaued of all men, can not vniuerſally be falſe. Hereunto he addeth, that there are very many dreames, of whiche an apte and mete reaſon may be geuen: whiche (as experience teacheth) deceaue not men, but haue their ſucceſſe. Therefore it is not mete that we ſhould deſpiſe all manner of diuination by dreames. Howbeit we muſt receaue it warely, for that it is very heard to geue cauſes thereof, bycauſe nature in this parte woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth very obſcurely.<note place="margin">Ariſtotle thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not that dreames are ſent of God.</note> And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinketh not that dreames are ſent of God.

Neyther can we eaſely ſe why he ſhould chooſe the night vnto him for that purpoſe. And laſtly foraſmuch as god is not enuious, he woulde not ſo obſcurelye admoniſhe them, whome he would inſtruct of thinges to come, but he would ſhewe them manifeſtly and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. But dreames are ſo obſcure, that for the interpretation of them we muſte go vnto prophetes, and ſouthſayers.

Neither do the phiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s contemne theſe things, yea rather (as <hi>Galene</hi> and <hi>Hipocrates</hi> teach) they enquire very diligently of the ſick, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: bycauſe therby they may vnderſtand the tempe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe humors which lye inwardly hidden.<note place="margin">Why forms ar more ſene ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping then wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng.</note> But the cauſe why they which are on ſlepe, &amp; not they which are waking, do by ſight fele the nature of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cions, is this: bicauſe at the beginning they are little, &amp; when we ar waking, the ſenſe of them flieth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. For by ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger mocions of outward things, which ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pear before our eyes, we ar drawn an other way, but being on ſlepe we ceſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward labours, &amp; ar voyd from the courſe of groſſe ſenſible things. Wherfore the ſightes and images, which are by the humors continually moued, are better comprehended of the fanſy when we are on ſleepe, then when we are wakinge. And that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſlepe we far better fele ſmalthings, then we do being waking: hereby it appeareth, bycauſe we thinke that noyſes, be they neuer ſo ſmall, are great thunders. And if any ſwete fleame ſticke peraduenture vnto the tounge or roofe of the mouth, it ſemeth to vs that we taſte hony, ſugar, ſweete wines, and pleaſant meates, yea ſometimes we thinke that we largely eate, and aboundant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye drinke. Wherfore thoſe mocions of humors which are ſmall, are in ſlepe ſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed to be as it were wonderfull greate: for whiche cauſe Phyſicions do hereby know very many beginninges of diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Dreames alſo are certayn ſignes of the affections of the minde,<note place="margin">Dreames ar al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo ſignes of the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the minde.</note> as of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, hope, ioy, and mirth, and alſo of qualityes. Wherfore fearfull perſons do ſe other maner of things then they do, which ar bold: ſo do they which ar couetous ſe other thinges, then they whych are in hope: alſo the learned are wont to haue farre contrary dreames, to the dreames of the rude people or artificers. For the mynd alſo when we ſlepe, is occupied aboute thoſe thynges, wherein when we are wakinge, we are either daylye, or els verye often buſyed. There is an other thynge alſo dilygentlye to bee obſerued (as <hi>Galene</hi> dooth verye well admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe) that there are certayne kyndes of meates,<note place="margin">Galene.</note> whyche beynge naturallye cholerike, melancholike, or fleumatik, do by theyr quality, or about the phantaſy
<pb facs="tcp:18396:142"/> of the ſleepers moue images and formes, which ar agreable with thoſe humors, although the temperature of bodies of them which ſlepe dooe not of themſelues offend in theſe humors. Which thing alſo the phiſicion ought to obſerue concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge dreames, namely to ſee what meat the ſick man did vſe. Wine alſo (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> teacheth) beinge immoderatelye dronke, doth in dreames engender miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed Images.</p>
                  <p>When a dreame is a ſign it is referred vnto a cauſe, namely vnto the humors abounding, which humors it ſignifieth. It maye alſo be called a ſigne of ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent to come, bycauſe from the ſame cauſe, that is, from the humors whiche are ſignified, may be cauſed eyther ſicknes or health. Wherefore a dreame, as it is a ſigne of an humor, ſo alſo is it a token of an effect, which is produced of it. For from the ſelf ſame cauſe, namely from the humor, ſpringeth both a dreame, and alſo a diſceaſe. Howbeit they are not conuerted, for ſicknes or health are not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of dreames.<note place="margin">Dreames are ſomtimes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which we do.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now let vs ſee, how dreames may ſomtimes be called the cauſes. That is then, when any man by his dreame is perſwaded, eyther to do, or to trye any thing, as if a man be made whole of the ſicknes of the ſplen, for that that he was let bloud in the vtward ſide of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for ſo was he taught to do in hys dreame. And now and then it happneth vnto the learned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they find thoſe things wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of they are in doubt in the ſame bokes, where in theyr dreame they thought they had found or red them.<note place="margin">Dreames ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time by chanſe reſemble thoſe thinges which happen.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now let vs conſider the third me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the diſtinction which we brought, namely when dreames do raſhly or by chaunce ſignify thoſe things which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward do happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That taketh place in thoſe things, whoſe cauſe is not in vs, but rather diſtant, and far of, as if a man ſhould ſee a victory, or a murther to happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hoſtes far diſtant from him, or any man that is abſent exalted to very greate dignity. Theſe thinges ſay the <hi>Peripatitikes</hi> are ioyned together by chaunce: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther canne they be conferred together, eyther as cauſes, or as ſignes. Euen as if when we are talking of any body, the ſame man paradueuture come in the mean while, we ſay <hi>Lupus eſt in fabula,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet the ſame mencion making of him, was neyther the cauſe, nor ſigne of hys commyng. So therfore theſe thinges are ſayd to be ioyned together raſhlye, bycauſe both they come by chaunce, and alſo they ſeldome haue ſucceſſe: for this is the nature of things comming by chaunce, to happen ſeldome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Who they be which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oftentimes ſe tru dreames</note>Farther, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath taught, who they be, which aboue other foretell many things in dreames. And the ſame be chiefly attributeth vnto idle perſons &amp; ſuch as ar euer pratling, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch as ar melancholike &amp; phrantike, which are depri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued both of ſences and minde. He ſeemeth alſo to aſcribe ſomewhat vnto kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes and friendes. For theſe kind of men haue very many dreames when they ſlepe. For pratlers and idle perſons are wholy voyde of cogitations, wherefore they at inwardly fylled with images and formes. The melancholike alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the power and nature of melancholy, do dreame very many thinges. Far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, they ar very much geuen vnto cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The phrantike alſo, bicauſe their mind is void both of the knowledge of the outward ſenſes, and alſo of the vſe of reaſon: therfore they ar vtterly geuen to imaginations. Laſtly, frends do for that cauſe ſe many things of their frends in theyr dreames, bicauſe they ar very much careful and penſiue for them. Al theſe men now rehearſed, are wont by dreames to foretell many thinges, bycauſe in diuerſe dreames and in a manner infinite, it is not poſſible, but that ſome true thinges happen ſometymes. They whyche the whole day excerciſe themſelues in ſhootynge, do much oftner bit the marke, then they which do very ſeldom ſhoote. And they which play al the day at dyſe or tables, do much oftener throw good caſtes, then they which little or ſeldome vſe that kinde of play.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit we muſt vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe ſignes, which ar attributed to dreames,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18396:142"/> as touching the fyrſt kynde alredy declared, are not neceſſary,<note place="margin">Of dreames which ar ſigns there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectes to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> for aſmuch as they may be letted. And yet this hindreth not but that they may be ſigns. For this is ſo alſo in the clouds, which vndoubtedly ar ſignes of rain, when as for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes they are diſcipated by the wind before it rayn. And vrine hath tokens ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſicknes or helth, when yet the effect may be letted by vehementer cauſes, &amp; the ſame alſo happeneth of the pulſes. Yea and thoſe counſels, which we haue appoynted, and which with great deliberation decree to do, very oftentimes are not accompliſhed, bycauſe ſome other thinges happen betwene, wherby we can go no farther: which ſelf ſame thinge if it happen in dreames, it is no maruayle, foraſmuche as they are ſignes of thinges not perfecte, but rather of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of thinges, and thoſe weake and feable mouinges of humors maye yet be eaſely letted of many other cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Democritus</hi> thus expoundeth thoſe dreames,<note place="margin">Democritus.</note> which reſemble thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by chaunce, and farre diſtante: There are alwayes (ſaythe he) defluctions from things themſelues, which ar caried to the bodies of thoſe that ſlepe, and do affect them with the quality and ſymilitude which they bring with them. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame he affirmeth to be for two cauſes more felt ſleping then waking. Firſt, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre by night is eaſlyer moued, as we ſee done, when the water is ſmitten with a little ſtone, very many circles ar with that ſtroke multiplied and driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great way, vnleſſe ſome other contrary motion reſiſte it. But in the nighte the ayre is more quiet, then in the day time, bycauſe it is not driuen into ſundry parts by the courſe of creaturs which moue themſelfes. An other cauſe is, bicauſe they which ſlepe do eaſlier receaue light mouings. And laſtly the ſame author alſo referreth not the cauſes of dreames to god.<note place="margin">Galene.</note>

                     <hi>Galene</hi> alſo in his little booke whiche he wrote <hi>de preſagiis in ſomniorum,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other thinges maketh mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dreames we ſe thoſe thinges, which when we were waking, we neither did nor thought, they ought not to be referred neither to artes, neyther to qualities, or cuſtome of thoſe things, which happened when we wer wakinge, but vnto humors. This rule ſeemeth to tende to thys end, that we might vnderſtand of what thinges dreames are to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſignes. And he graunteth that theſe things are better knowen in the night, then in the day, bycauſe then the ſoul withdraweth it ſelf into the inward parts wher it eaſilier feleth thoſe things which ar ther.<note place="margin">An hiſtory of a certayn dream.</note> And he maketh mencion of one who thought in his dreame he had a thigh of ſtone, which many thought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn to his ſeruants, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in a few dayes after that, his legge fel into a palſey. An other thought that he was vp to the throte in a ceſterne full of bloude, out of which he could by no meanes eſcape. And that declared that much bloud aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in hym, and that he had very great neede to be let bloud. He maketh mention alſo of an other, which in his dreame thought that on his critical or iudiciall day he was waſhed in a bath wyth great aboundance of water, who afterward fell into a great ſweat. Farther ſayth he they which ſlepe do thinke ſometimes that they are greuouſely laden, ſo that they ar not able to beare the wayght: &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo light and nimble, that they run, &amp; in a manner fly.

                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo of theſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs in a maner writeth the ſame namely that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind in the day time, deſtributeth his powers into the ſenſes &amp; other faculties:<note place="margin">Hippocrates.</note> And in the night it draweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward parts, &amp; therfore it doth the better know them. Howbeit he maketh mencion that there are certayn dreames which come by god, wherby calamities are foreſhewed to come vnto cities, people, and other certayne greate men, for the expounding of which dreames, ſome do profeſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne artes. Vnto which neuertheleſſe he ſemeth to geue but very ſmall credite. When by dreames it is noted that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humors do offend, he ſayth that they which are in daunger, muſt be holpen by diete, exorciſt, and medicine. And whither the dreames be good or euil, he will haue prayers added. When helth is by dreames
<pb facs="tcp:18396:143"/> ſignified, we muſt pray ſayth he vnto the Sunne, vnto <hi>Iupiter</hi> celeſtiall, <hi>Iupiter</hi> poſſeſſor, to <hi>Minerua,</hi> rich <hi>Mercury,</hi> and to <hi>Apollo.</hi> But if the dreames be vnluc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ky, we muſt pray vnto the goddes ſayth he which turne awaye ill, namely vnto the goddes of the earthe, and to the Heroicall men, &amp;c. Wherfore eyther <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> was ſuperſticious, or els he would ſeme ſo. But to me, as touching ſincere godlines, that I miſlike not: Yea it is very much commended, that if at any time wee be vexed with troubleſome and terrible dreames, we muſte praye vnto god, that it would pleaſe him to turne away thoſe euils, if there be anye whiche hange ouer our heddes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What is the outward cauſe of dreames.</note>There is an other kinde of dreames, whiche procedeth of an outward cauſe, namely from the power of heauen, or (as it is commonlye called) the influence, which altereth the ayre. For this ayre touching our bodies, affecteth them with a new quality: Wherby ſundrye images and dreames are ſtirred vp vnto thoſe which are on ſleepe. Wherfore there are manye effectes wroughte of heauen, of whych it bringeth forth ſome in the phantaſy, and power or faculty of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and other ſome in deede. And that may eaſely be ſhewed by an example. In dede in the ayre or cloudes there are raine: and in the imaginacion of the Crow there is ſuch an alteration before the rayne, that he beginneth to croke. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effects in the phantaſy of thoſe which ar on ſlepe, and alſo in dede, come vndoubtedly of the ſelf ſame cauſe: Yet haue they great diuerſity by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſubiectes in which they are made. And it is not to be doubted, but that there is a certayne ſlender and hidden ſimilitude betweene theſe effectes. But it is verye hard to vnderſtand the reaſon of this proporcion or analogy. And if we ſay, that the ſtarres are the cauſe of ſuch effectes or affections, who can refer theſe ſignes vnto his own propre cauſe,<note place="margin">Why diuinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by dreames is hard and vncer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne.</note> that is, to ſome certayne ſtarres more then to other, Aſſuredly I ſuppoſe that there are very few (I will not ſay none) whiche can do it. Farther if they ſhuld alſo be referred vnto propre ſtarres, what can we iudge to come to paſſe by them, eſpecially as touching things comming by happe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as iudiciall Aſtrology is euermore counted moſte vncertayne? In fyne, images &amp; &amp; ſimilituds which ar ſayd to portend things to come, ar ſo doubtful, vncertain &amp; ambiguous, that we can affyrm nothing for certayn of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore this is to be added, that foraſmuch as dreams cannot be broght to paſſe of one only cauſe, but of many (as we haue declared) we ſhall eaſely fal into an error, if we of thoſe many cauſes chuſe onely one certayne cauſe. Therefore let vs hold this, that is, not eaſely to foretel any thing by dreames, for that they may eaſlier de iudged by the euentes, then the euentes can by them be foretold. Wherefore there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of dreames but onely a certayne ſuſpicion, whiche alſo of neceſſity is verye ſclender.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A gate of horn &amp; a gate of pue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye.</note>The two moſt noble Poetes, <hi>Homere</hi> (I ſay) and <hi>Virgill,</hi> made twoo gates of dreames, the one of horne, the other of yuery. That of horne (as they ſay) pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto the true dreames, and that of yuery, to falſe: and they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the greteſt part paſſeth through the gate of yuery, and not through that of horn. Wherfore in iudging naturall dreames, let vs not paſſe the meaſure of ſuſpition, nor ſtick to much in dreames: foraſmuch as it is not the duty of a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man to cleaue more then is conueniente vnto perillous and vncertayne coniectures, bicauſe whileſt they ſo buſily apply them ſelfes to thoſe things,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Nowe let vs ſee, what we oughte to affirme of dreames ſente of God, or moued by the deuel. When any thing by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of god or of angels is in dreams foreſene, twoo thyngs are required. The fyrſte is that certayne notes or images of things which are ſhewed, do inform or imprint the phantaſy or imagination.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18396:143"/> Secondly muſt be adioyned iudgement, to vnderſtand what thoſe things at the laſt do portend. As touching the firſt, we muſt know, that theſe notes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are ſomtimes offred vnto the ſenſes, bicauſe of thoſe things which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth outwardly to appeare, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Balthazar</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Nebuchad-Naezar</hi> ſaw in the wall the fyngers of a hande which wrote, as it appeareth in <hi>Daniel.</hi> And ſomtimes without any outward ſight are images and formes deſcribed in the imagination or phantaſy: which happeneth two maner of waies. For either the formes or images which are kept in the minde, are called backe to ſuch vſe as God hath entended, as when to <hi>Ieremy</hi> was ſhewed a ſeething pot tourned to the North: Or els newe formes are ſhewed, whyche by the ſenſes were neuer ſeene, as if formes of coulours and images ſhoulde bee ſhewed vnto one blynde from hys byrth.</p>
                  <p>And in this kinde or propheſieng, images or formes are in ſteede of letters.<note place="margin">Formes or ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges ar lyke let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> For as they are ordered and diſpoſed, ſo ſundry oracles are ſhewed. Euen as in the diuers chaunging of letters, orations and ſentences are made diuers. Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers which inſtruct their ſcholers, may by their ſtudy and induſtry of teaching faſhion manifold images in the mindes of the hearers: although they be not able to geue the iudgement and right vnderſtanding. But God miniſtreth both,<note place="margin">
                        <p>God ſomtimes geueth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one &amp; to the ſelfe ſame man formes, and the vnderſtandyng of them.</p>
                        <p>They whych haue onely ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply prophecies.</p>
                     </note> not in dede alwaies together: for to ſome ſometimes he ſheweth onely the formes, as to <hi>Pharao,</hi> and to his Butler and Baker, &amp; alſo to the king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> al which men needed an Interpretor (namely <hi>Ioſeph</hi> &amp; <hi>Daniel</hi>) to expound their dreames. And vndoubtedly thoſe, vnto whom are ſhewed onely the images of thinges to come, are not truely and plainly counted Prophets, foraſmuch as they haue but onely a certaine degree, beginning, and in a maner a ſtep of prophecye: euen as <hi>Caiphas</hi> alſo the high Prieſt is not to be counted a Prophet, when as hee ſpake thoſe thinges which he knew not.</p>
                  <p>But why God would ſometimes by dreames manifeſt vnto Kinges &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thinges to come, as now he doth, there are two cauſes: The one is, bycauſe he had a regarde vnto the people and Nations whom they gouerned. For if the penury which was at hand, had not ben ſhewed vnto <hi>Pharao,</hi> Egipt had vtterly bene deſtroyed by famine. Secondly, it was the counſel of the Lorde, by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of dreames, to manifeſt vnto the world his Prophetes and holy men, which before were hidden, which thing the holy ſcriptures teſtifye happened in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> The Ethnike Hiſtoriographers alſo do write verye manye thinges of dreames, which Princes ſometimes ſaw. Yea,<note place="margin">Tertulian.</note> and <hi>Tertulian</hi> in hys booke <hi>de Anima,</hi> maketh mencion of certayn of thoſe dreames, as the dreame of <hi>Aſtyages</hi> of his daughter <hi>Mandane,</hi> alſo of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and of <hi>Iulius Oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tauius,</hi> whom <hi>M.

                  <p>But omitting theſe, let vs by teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures (which ſhall eaſily be done) confirm, that certain dreames ar ſent by God. <hi>Mathew</hi> teſtifieth that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the houſbande of <hi>Mary,</hi> was in dreames thriſe admoniſhed by the Angel. The wyfe alſo of <hi>Pilate</hi> had knowledge by a dreame, and ſent woorde to her houſband, that he ſhould not condemne Chriſt being an innocent. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Actes of the Apoſtles the x. chap. ſaw a ſheete let downe from heauen.

And that we ſhould not be ignorant of his doing, the holy hiſtory declareth that the Ethnikes were by God verye oftentimes admoniſhed and corrected in theyr ſleepe. So <hi>Pharao</hi> king of <hi>Egipt</hi> was commaunded to reſtore vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> his wife, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> king of <hi>Gerar</hi> was in like maner admoniſhed. And <hi>Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſaith moreouer, that euen as God, when hee inſtructed the wycked in theyr ſleepe, doth it that they might become good: ſo contrariwiſe the Deuil inuadeth the godly when they are a ſleepe, by dreames to ſeduce them oute of the ryghte way. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God in diſtributing his giftes, ought to haue a regard to wiſe men, and eſpecially to Philoſophers:<note place="margin">God reuealeth miſteries ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto the li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle ones, then to the wyſe.</note> when as Chriſt hath taughte alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether otherwiſe.

                  <p>An other argument was, that beaſtes alſo when they ſleepe do dreame, when yet no man wil ſay that God miniſtreth and diſpoſeth their dreames. That Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſopher is deceaued, bicauſe he ſuppoſeth that if God do ſend ſome dreames vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, he ought therefore to be made author of al dreames, which vndoubtedly to farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our meaning.

Wherefore, though God do miniſter ſome dreames, wee may not thereby gather, that all dreames, whether they be in beaſtes or men, ar ſent by hym. Beaſtes otherwyſe haue the power to heare, neither want they eares: and yet, bicauſe God ſendeth not ſomtimes Prophets vnto them to ſpeake and ſhewe them thynges to come, we cannot conclude that God doth not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſende holy men vnto men, by whom they maye bee both admoniſhed, and inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith moreouer, that if God were the author of dreames, he woulde cauſe them to be done as wel in the day time, as in the night. But I affirme,<note place="margin">God vſeth both times, as well the daye as the nyght.</note> that it is free for God to vſe eyther time as he wil, foraſmuch as he is Lord as well of the day as of the night, and as wel of ſleeping as of waking. And that he ſomtimes did in very deede ſhew viſions vnto prophets in their ſleepe, &amp; ſometimes when they wer waking, as it ſemed beſt vnto him, the holy ſcriptures do reſtlfy.</p>
                  <p>Farther, what abſurdity is it, if he oftentimes vſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of the nyght and ſleepe, when as the Philoſophers and Phiſitions them ſelues doo confeſſe, that men are at ſuch time more apt to receaue mocions very light?

In the booke of <hi>Iob</hi> the .33. chap. there is a godly and apt place written after this maner: when ſlepe falleth vpon men, and they ſleepe vpon their beds, then God openeth the eare, and ſealeth corrections.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly was obiected, that God if he would admoniſh men, he would do it open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and manifeſtly, &amp; not obſcurely, or by rydles. I anſwer, that the true prophets and ſuch as were inſpired by God, did very wel vnderſtand the thinges whyche God told them in ſuch dreames: wherefore they needed no expoſiters. And if hee ſomtimes ſent dreames vnto Ethnike Princes (as he did vnto <hi>Pharao</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchad-Nezar</hi>) he therfore did it, to make his Prophetes that wer hidden (name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi>) to be notable.

But this is not at this daye obſerued: for the watches are not kept on the night of Eaſter, but on the night of the Natiuity.</p>

                  <p>Of thoſe foure principall affections, theſe are now to be entreated of, whiche haue their begynnyng of Heuyneſſe, or Grief. And they alſo are reckened to be foure.

                  <p>But before we entreate particularly of them, one thing is to be enquired of: Whether Affections are to be counted good or euill. The <hi>Stoikes</hi> affirme that they are euill, and they haue vniuerſally condemned affections,<note place="margin">

Farther, bicauſe by their wayght they oftentymes driue men to perpetrate filthy and vniuſt things: yea and they hurte the body alſo, when they are very vehement. Theſe in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are the reaſons of the <hi>Stoikes.</hi> The <hi>Peripatecians</hi> teache muche otherwiſe, that is, that thoſe things are not true, which the <hi>Stoikes</hi> affirme,<note place="margin">The Peripate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cians.</note> but when affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not chaſtiſed &amp; kept vnder by reaſon, then are they ſuffred immoderatly to runne at randon. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affections, if they be kept in with certain bondes, are both good and profitable, as beyng the matter of vertues, and whiche are by nature appoynted for their whetſtones. For anger bringeth no ſmall helpe vnto ſtrength, and mercy is ſet vnder the vertue of clemency. And in the ſame maner it may be ſayd of many other.</p>
                  <p>But this ſentence wherin the Philoſophers do ſo diſagre,<note place="margin">What the holy ſcriptures affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> muſt be decided by the iudgement of the holy ſcriptures.

Wherfore for aſmuch as he planted affections in man, but not euill and corrupt, as now we haue them, but right and ſound, which ſhould obey and ſerue reaſon, they muſt of neceſſity be good.

                  <head>¶Of Mercy.</head>
                  <p>MErcy is a grief of the minde, which we take for the aduerſity of other men,<note place="margin">Cicero.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:149"/> that Mercy is ſtirred vp, if we ſee any ſuffre greuous things which they haue not deſerued. For if wicked men be iuſtly puniſhed, Mercy is not therfore ſtirred vp. Farther he thinketh, that thoſe caſes whiche we pitye, ſhould be terrible, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if they be but light, we are by them litle or nothing moued. Laſtly that they are touched with mercy, which do thinke that ſuch things may ſometymes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen either vnto themſelues or to ſome of their friendes. Which is the cauſe, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſuppoſeth, that they which are in proſperity, and do iudge themſelues happy, are not prone vnto mercy, yea they ar wont to ſcoffe &amp; mocke thoſe which are in miſery, as they which thinke nothing can hurte them. Likewiſe he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this affection from ſuch as are deſperate and in a moſt miſerable ſtate, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not afrayd that any worſe thing can happen vnto them, then that whiche they haue already. Wherfore they ſeme in that deſperate fortune to haue become men without ſenſes. But if this were true, a man might doubt, by what meanes mercy can be aſcribed vnto God, for aſmuch as he without controuerſy is moſt bleſſed, and nothing can hurt hym. But to this might be anſwered, that mercy is not properly attributed vnto god, but by a metaphore taken of man, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth thoſe things,<note place="margin">Mercy is alſo to be ſhewed vnto thoſe which iuſtly ar puniſhed.</note> which mercifull men are wont to do. For they helpe the afflicted, which ſelf ſame thing god alſo doeth. But in this thing I agree not vnto <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whiche will not haue mercy to be ſhewed vnto thoſe whiche are iuſtly puniſhed. For <hi>Samuel</hi> mourned long time for <hi>Saul,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God reiected not vnworthily, but moſt iuſtly. Chriſt alſo wept ouer the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which was at hand vnto that City, not vndoubtedly without deſerte, but iuſtly. Neither thinke I this true, that ſinnes, which ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commit, do not ſtirre vp mercy, but onely calamityes &amp; aduerſityes do ſtirre vp mercy. For holy men are no leſſe grieued for other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cauſes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they fal into grieuous ſinnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are when they be oppreſſed with euil fortune, yea they ar ſo much the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as that euil is more pernicious, and leſſe able to be cured. Wherfore we can not deny, but that mercy is a good affection, for as much as it obeyeth the worde of God and reaſon, eſpecially ſeyng the Lord by his own mouth hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the mercifull are bleſſed, bycauſe they alſo ſhall obtayne mercy.</p>
                  <p>The other affection which hath his beginning of Heuineſſe or Grief, is called <hi>Nemeſis:</hi>

Iuſt and holy men are ſicke oftentymes of this affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Dauid</hi> when he ſaw the vngodly floriſhing, ſaid: My fete were almoſt moued. <hi>Abacuk</hi> alſo, was grieued that the vngodly were of ſuch force, that they could oppreſſe the ſaintes, and deuoure the iuſt. And <hi>Iob</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in a maner to complayne vnto his friends for the ſame thing. Farther <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche</hi> in the lyfe of <hi>Homere</hi> praiſeth this affection,<note place="margin">Plutarche.</note> and by occaſion therof he far preferreth the <hi>Peripatecians</hi> in diſputing of Affections before the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the iudgement of <hi>Homere,</hi> who affirmeth that God at the length will angerly puniſhe, after that the wicked haue a certayne while floriſhed. Howbeit this is to be obſerued, that men are not grieued with this affection, for that they ſhall ſuffer any loſſe, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the proſperous ſucceſſe of the wicked, or bycauſe that they by their power can hurt them. For if they were in this maner grieued, thei ſhould not be troubled with <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> but rather with feare. But <hi>Nemeſis</hi> is then, when a man for the lucky ſucceſſe of the wicked, is moued with aſtomake &amp; hatred of the vnworthineſſe of the perſon.</p>

But then at the laſt we are affected with <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> when thoſe good things come vnto wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with which we thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be rewarded, as are riches, honours, power, fauor, &amp; ſuch like. But god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men muſt wiſely deale with this affection, that when their myndes are affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, bycauſe of the felicity of the vngodly, let them haue a regarde vnto God, which is the true gouerner and diſtributer of all good things. Wherfore if men ſhould beſtow theſe outwarde goods vpon the vnworthy, their vniuſtice might iuſtly be reproued. But ſuch a reprehenſion hath no place in God, bycauſe he doth all things moſt iuſtly.

But Enuidence pertayneth to them, which conſume away with this diſeaſe. And therfore he thinketh that Enuy or Enuidence is therfore ſo called, bycauſe that they which are enuious, do to much looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other mens fortune. Enuy therfore is a grief which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s proſperity, eſpecially of thoſe which are equal &amp; like vnto vs. For a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enuieth not a king, neither do beggers enuy noble men. We enuy thoſe that are like &amp; equall vnto vs. And the likeneſſe is to be vnderſtand, as touching kinred, riches, beawty, age, witte, dignity, and ſuch like. The cauſe of Enuidence is not, bycauſe we feare that ſome hurte is at hand of thoſe whom we enuy: for that ſhould be feare. But of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne hatred and ſtomacke we can not abide the proſperity of other men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of our matches and like.

                  <p>Enuy is euermore counted euill, and it is by the holy ſcriptures grieuouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. For it is moſt manifeſtly againſt Charity.

                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Tuſculan</hi> queſtions, defineth it to be a grief, which procedeth of that, that an other enioyeth that good thing whiche we deſire. The ſame writer obſerueth alſo, that Emulation is ſometymes ſo taken, that it nothing differeth from Enuidence: wherfore it is ſometymes reproued. But if the definition therof be receaued, as it is now alledged, it is an affection laudable, bycauſe it maketh men better: for it vſeth to bring forth the imitacion of good things.<note place="margin">

                        <p>The matter wherin Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed.</p>
                        <p>Emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath hope ioyned with it.</p>
                        <p>The Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were ſicke of Enuy, and not of Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     </note> But we muſt take hede, whiche vndoubtedly is eaſely done, that it degenerate not into Enuy, and Emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> procede not ſo farre, that we ſhould wiſh that men fortunate and noble, and alſo wiſe men, might be ſpoyled of theyr ornamentes &amp; good things. Wherfore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayd, that that Emulation is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, which is not like vnto riuality. For this is the nature of thoſe that be <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uales,</hi> ſo to enioy their delightes, that they vtterly exclude all other. But addyng theſe cautions, Emulation is both good and holy. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to emulate Charity, and the chiefeſt giftes. This affection is chiefly occupied about vertues, and al thinges which are had in honour and admiracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that which a man contemneth and diſpyſeth, he vſeth not to emulate. Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath Hope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ioyned with it, of obteyning that which it deſireth. For if a man ſhould diſpayre, it is not poſſible that he ſhould emulate. And thus much of theſe affections.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore we gather that the <hi>Ephraites</hi> were moued with enuy againſt <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> bycauſe they would haue him depriued of the glory whiche he had gotten. Neither contended they ſo, bycauſe they ſtudyed to do the like, although peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture they made that their pretence. But <hi>Gideon</hi> maketh not mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them of his vocation, labour, induſtry, loue of his countrey, his good acte, &amp; ſuch other thinges, which might haue ſerued to the amplifieng of hys deſerte towarde the people, and of his dignity. For by that meanes he ſhould the more haue moued them to enuy: but after a ſort he gaue place vnto them, &amp; interpreteth their affec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, as though it were an honeſt emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And teacheth them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of this affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bycauſe they had not only imitated him, but they had done more then he had accompliſhed.

                  <p>If theſe vngodly and rude men had bene wiſe, they would haue ioyned them ſelues vnto him, to aſſiſte his endeuor in fighting for the common health. But this they do not impudently deny bread whiche men vſe to geue vnto ſuche as are weary and hungry, although they be ſtraungers. A wonderfull diuerſity vndoubtedly of things: The <hi>Madianites</hi> which were ſtrangers, were afrayd and fled: but thoſe whiche were Iſraelites, mocke <hi>Gideon</hi> the conquerer. If thou wilt ſaye they were ignoraunt of hys vocation: we may aunſwere, that they could not denye, but that his worke was good. But graunt that they doubted of the vocation and principality of <hi>Gideon,</hi> what excuſe at the laſte can theyr moſte wanton deriſion haue? For ſo did <hi>Nabal</hi> the <hi>Carmilite</hi> behaue hymſelfe towarde <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he required ſome meate of hym for hys Souldiers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng mencion of hys fayth, and the fidelitye of hys men, in ſafegardyng hys thynges. But he dyd not onely denye vnto hym that humanity, but ſent awaye the meſſangers laden with contumelyes. The thynges which <hi>Gideon</hi> required, were iuſte and honeſty.<note place="margin">Stipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and victuales are due vnto an hoſte whiche goeth on war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</note> For ſtipendes and vittailes are due vnto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, for as muche as he laboureth for the publicque vtility. Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth: Therefore ye geue vnto hym tribute, bycauſe he is the Miniſter of God, namely in defendyng the innocent, and puniſhyng the guilty. Wherefore they of <hi>Succoth</hi> were bounde to geue thoſe thynges whiche were deſired, by the duety of iuſtice. For the ſame Apoſtle writeth, render vnto euery man that whiche is due: to whome tribute belongeth, tribute, to whom cuſtome is due, cuſtome, &amp;c. The Ethnikes alſo ſaw this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as there are many ciuiles lawes exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whiche doo both weyghtely and moſte iuſt prouide, that Souldiers ſhould haue vittay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les founde them, when they goo on warfare. And howe muche they ſynned in mockyng ſo greate a man, we may gather by the wordes of Chriſt, who ſayeth: If a man ſaye vnto an other man foole, or Racha, be ſhalbe guilty of iudgement and Counſell: how muche more ſhall he be condemned, whiche wantonly ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth and mocketh hys Magiſtrate? Some prynces dyd ſeuerely puniſhe thoſe whiche with contumelyes reproched euen theyr images: what ought this man to doo with thoſe, whiche ſo mocked hym to hys face? Theſe thynges I therfore ſpeake, that we ſhoulde not thinke that <hi>Gideon</hi> did vniuſtly threaten them. It is not for priuate men to reuenge theyr owne iniuryes: But it is the office of the Magiſtrate to reuenge both hys owne iniuryes and other mennes, and in reuengyng hys owne, he reuengeth alſo other mennes iniuryes. For what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contumely is committed agaynſte a prince, it redoundeth vnto the publique wealth and all princes. <hi>Gideon</hi> at thys preſent dyd onely threaten, yet he ſtayed not there, leaſt by occaſion of reuengyng of hys owne iniury, the commodity of the victorye, whereunto he was called by God, ſhoulde be hindred. He differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therefore that whiche belonged vnto hymſelfe: but with ſpede he proſecuteth that, whiche chiefely pertayned to the delyuery of the publicque wealth. But princes at thys daye do otherwiſe, who rather make warre amonge themſelues, and that for very lyght cauſes, then they will take in hande a common cauſe and defence agaynſte the Turke. Yea and there are ſome, and thoſe of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalles, whiche write that they will (if they can) call backe <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelfe from that courſe of victory, wherwith he might obteyne agayne euen the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and to puniſhe the <hi>Germaynes</hi> and <hi>Engliſhemen,</hi> and other whiche fell from the Churche of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, <hi>Gideon</hi> is for thys thyng to be prayſed, namely bycauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe meate wanted, and he was deſpyſed of the Hebrues, yet he deſiſted not from that vocation, wherein he was conſtituted by GOD.

But it myght be, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thys acte nowe when they came to make thys warre, or els before when euery yeare they inuaded the lande of the Iſraelites in the tyme of harueſt.

                  <p>But might not he haue committed that office vnto a hangeman? why would he ſo vrge hys ſonne? To thys maye be aunſwered two wayes. Firſte that in the olde tyme it was not vncomely to ſlay the guylty. Farther,<note place="margin">The Hebrues had no hange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> that it is not ſene that the Hebrues had hangemen. And vndoubtedly, that thys was no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice amonge the Hebrues, this teſtifieth, bycauſe in the lawe it is written, that a blaſphemer beyng taken, was ſo ſtoned to death, that the hande of the wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes dyd throwe the firſte ſtone agaynſte hym: neyther was the puttyng to death of any body committed to any peculiar hangeman. And there are many examples whiche teſtifye that it was not ignominious to ſlaye the guilty. <hi>Saul</hi> when he woulde haue the Prieſtes ſlayne, called not hangemen to doo it, but turned to the noble men whiche were with hym, and commaunded them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the Prieſtes: who reuerenſyng theyr miniſtery and dignitye, durſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Onely <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite</hi> durſt execute ſo greate a wycked acte, who was not of leaſt eſtimation with the kynge. <hi>Samuell</hi> alſo with hys owne hande ſlewe kynge <hi>Agag</hi> the pryſoner. <hi>Ioab</hi> in lyke manner when he had cought holde of the horne of the altar, was ſlayne of <hi>Banaia</hi> the chiefe Capitayne of the hoſte. Wherefore it ſeemeth that the Hebrues in that auncient tyme hadde no hangemen.</p>
                  <p>But as muche as maye be gathered by the Hyſtoryes of the Ethnikes,<note place="margin">Lictores, were miniſters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute corporall puniſhment. <hi>Plutarche.</hi>

They had alſo cordes to bynde the Citezins withall, that beyng bounde, they myght eyther beate them with roddes, or ſtrike them with the axe. But the men of more auncient tyme wanted thys office: euery man executed it without any infamy, as it was by the Magiſtrate commaunded hym. And in verye dede that woorke of puniſhyng malefactors, hath in it no diſhoneſtye or vncomelyneſſe, For if it be honeſt, for a iudge or prince to geue ſentence of death agaynſt euyll doers, why then ſhall it not be iuſte and honeſt to execute the ſame ſentence? Yea and GOD hymſelfe in puniſhyng, vſeth not onely euyll ſpirites, but good ſpirites.</p>

But the latter Romayne lawes, whiche are in the digeſtes, blotted out that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption: for in very dede it was vniuſt.

But in the meane tyme, with greate hypocriſie they take hede, that the ſentence be geuen by a laye Iudge (as they call hym) and ſo they wrappe themſelues out of that irregularity.

What if a man haue bene a Iudge or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, or in iuſte warre hath fought for hys countrey, can not he therefore be ordayned a Miniſter of the Churche?

Neither doubteth he to affirme, that this <hi>Iohn</hi> tranſgreſſed the decrees of Chriſt, the rules of the Apoſtles, and Cannons of the fathers. All theſe things ſayth he, hath he violated in the vſurpation of this one title. And he addeth, what wilt thou aunſwere vnto Chriſt in the laſt day of iudgement, thou that haſt arrogantly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon thee his office, and wilt haue al his members ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect vnto thee?

This I therefore admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you, forbycauſe the Apoſtles wer not byſhops of ſinguler churches, for they wandred abrode thorough out the whole worlde, they founded churches &amp; wan ſondry nacions vnto the Lord, and al they were members,<note place="margin">Another error of Gregory.</note> and that principal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The other thing, which I iudge is to be obſerued, is that <hi>Gregory</hi> doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that this his <hi>Iohn</hi> did fyrſt vſurpe vnto himſelf the title of vniuerſality,<note place="margin">Theodoretus.</note> which aſſuredly I cannot be perſwaded of.

                  <p>But before theſe times, <hi>Ciprian</hi> wythſtoode the churche of Rome,<note place="margin">Cipria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſiſted the church of Rome.</note> whoe ſought then to clayme vnto it ſelf ſome tiranny, and he iudged that appellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould not be brought vnto the ſeat of Rome, but would haue Eccleſiaſtical cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes iudged in euery ſinguler prouince: namely, that they which in any place wer condemned by the iudgement of byſhops, ſhould not be reſtored by the ayd of the ſeate of Rome: when as yet he chiefly reuerenced the church of Rome, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leged it as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Indede kings and magiſtrates may be called heads of the people, bicauſe they gouerne ciuily, and from them we may looke for good lawes and ciuyle mouinges: but in the church men entreat not of ciuile life, but of ſpiritual and eternall life, which we cannot loke for, but at gods hand, neyther can any mortall men quicken the members of the church.

But it is a ſporte to heare what <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſometimes B. of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> in defendyng the Pope au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18396:155"/> to this. To graunt two heads of the Church (ſayth he) is not abſurd: for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle writeth, the man is the head of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; neuertheles euery wife hath by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her huſband which is the head, an other head alſo. Wherfore he concluded that we may thus affirme of the church, namely that it hath both Chriſt and the Pope to be head. But this man faileth by a falſe <hi>Sillogiſmus</hi> of equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ſpeaking now of a head, as it is attributed vnto the Church, he falleth to a natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral head. In matrimony the huſband is the head of the wife, not the natural hed,<note place="margin">How the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the hed of the wyfe.</note> but as touching <hi>aeconomical</hi> life. But the natural head of the woman, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her natural life. And vndoubtedly if we looke vpon the natural head in the church, we ſhal finde that it is not one head: but looke howe manye men there be in it, ſo many heades ſhal there be: for there is none without an heade in it. And when we ſpeake of the head of the Churche, we muſt keepe our ſelues in the <hi>Metaphore:</hi> and as it ſhould be abſurde and monſtrous, for one man to haue two natural heades, ſo ſhal it be iudged as portentous, for the Churche to haue two Metaphorical, that is ſpiritual heads. We muſt alwaies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we entreate of any thing, perſiſt in the ſame order and kinde: which thing if wee doo not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, we ſhal eaſily be deceaued by equiuocation.</p>
                  <p>But let vs returne to the Pope,<note place="margin">Of the keyes foundation of the Churche.</note> who leaſt he ſhoulde ſeme to be deſtitute of teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures, taketh two places out of them. Whereof the one is: Vpon this rocke I wil builde my Churche, and wyll gyue the keyes. &amp;c. But that place pertaineth to al thoſe which confeſſe the verity of faith: for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when the Lord demaunded what the Apoſtles beleued of him, aunſwered in the name of them al, that he was the ſonne of the liuing God. Wherefore, that which Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto him, pertaineth to all them, whych together wyth him beleue and profeſſe the ſame ſelfe thing. For the keyes are geuen vnto the Church. And in <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Lord after his reſurrection gaue them vnto all them: at the laſt alſo, when he ſhould aſcend vp into heauen, he ſent them all alike to preache throughout the world. And as touching the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, the Church hath no other foundation but Chriſt. For <hi>Paul</hi> vnto the <hi>Corinth.</hi> ſayde: No man can lay any other foundation, then that which is already layde,<note place="margin">How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are called foundations of the Church.</note> which is Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And if at any time the Apoſtles be called foundacions of the churche, that is to be vnderſtand, bicauſe they in the firſt time of the Churche cleaued vnto the foundation, as the firſt and greater ſtones, not bicauſe the Churche leaned vnto them as to the principal foundation.</p>
                  <p>The other place which they bring out of the ſcriptures, is,<note place="margin">Not onely to Peter was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement geuen to feede the flocke of Chriſt.</note> bicauſe Chriſt ſaith vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> feede my Lambes. But they are excedingly deceaued: for it was not the office of Peter onely, but alſo of the other Apoſtles, to feede the flocke of the Lord. But it was ſo ſayd peculiarly vnto Peter, bicauſe he had denyed the Lord thriſe, and therefore he might haue ſeemed to haue fallen from the fellowſhip of the Apoſtles, vnles he had of Chriſt bene reſtored by certaine woordes. And that not onely he, but alſo other ought to feede the ſhepe of Chriſt, his own woordes teſtify, which be writeth in his Epiſtle, wher he admoniſheth other Miniſters to feede the flocke of the Lorde. But graunt, that the Lorde gaue vnto Peter anye principal thing: what hath the biſhop of Rome common with him? Let hym de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſpirite, and as Peter hath labored for the Church, let hym alſo labour: which thing if he performe, then wil we acknowledge him, not as an vniuerſal biſhop, but as a good Miniſter of Chriſt.<note place="margin">The ſpirite of Chriſt is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to chairs</note> He ſayth that hee hath the chaire that Peter had. What ſeate I pray you ſpeaketh he of? The holy ghoſt is not bounde to ſeates. But graunt that it were ſo, <hi>Antioche</hi> had Peter ſitting in it before <hi>Rome</hi> had. For that church he planted, and long whyle gouerned. But they ſay that he was ſlayne at <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Iewes crucified Chriſt himſelfe at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lem, which is a thing of greater waight. Wherfore if we ſhould follow this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the biſhop of Ieruſalem ſhould be preferred aboue all other. Yea, and Peter, as it is written to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> was not the Apoſtle of the Gentiles,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:156"/> but of circumciſion, as it was agreed betwene <hi>Paul, Iames, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> Neither do we euer reade that <hi>Peter</hi> preſcribed the other Apoſtles any thyng, or that they depended of him. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> moſt manifeſtly teſtifieth, that he receaued nothing of Peter. Farther, it is certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter was ſlain vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> liued euen to the time of <hi>Traiane.</hi> And they ſay that <hi>Cletus, Linus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> ſucceded Peter at <hi>Rome.</hi> What then, ſhal we thinke that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle was ſubiect vnto <hi>Clemens?</hi> And of neceſſity he ſhould be ſo, if the Byſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be the vniuerſal head or general biſhop.

What wyl they ſay here? The biſhop of Rome aſcribeth his title vnto the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Ieruſalem, and attributeth this vniuerſall charge of all Churches vnto him, and not to himſelfe. This argument maketh verye muche agaynſte thoſe, which haue vnto the Churches obtruded this Epiſtle for true, &amp; ratefied it. But that can nothing hurt vs, which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of that epiſtle, againſt our doctrine.

But if this were onely his deſyre, to keepe in perpetual memory the benefite of God, he is not to be accuſed, for as much as oftentimes ſuch monumentes were erected, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures teſtify. <hi>Iacob</hi> erected a ſtone, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went in to <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and whileſt he fled from <hi>Laban</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> he builded a great heape of ſtones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

                  <p>God had not commaunded in the law, to make an Ephod to this vſe, but one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that the Prieſtes ſhould put it on, when they ſhould doo ſacrifice. Neyther is it needeful now to deſcribe the forme of this garment, for as much as in <hi>Exodus</hi>

It was made of purple violet coulour, ſylke, &amp; ſcarlet, it had gold wrought in it, &amp; ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry kindes of moſt precious ſtones. There was alſo an other which was called <hi>Ephod bad,</hi> that is a linnen Ephod, whyche the <hi>Leuites</hi> alſo vſed in holy ſeruices. Wherfore in the .1. of <hi>Samuel</hi> the .2. chap. we reade, that <hi>Hanna</hi> made euery yeare for <hi>Samuel</hi> a litle coate and an Ephod, when ſhe had then offred him vnto the Lord, to miniſter at the tabernacle. Yea and <hi>Dauid</hi> being girt with an Ephod, daunced before the Arke of the Lord. The children alſo of <hi>Dauid</hi> were girt with an Ephod. But <hi>Gideon</hi> made his a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical and precious Ephod, for the other kinde was ſimple &amp; of linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherefore he ſhould not haue neded ſo great coſt to make ſuch a one.

But of this ſentence we wyll afterwarde ſpeake, when we declare <hi>Auguſtines</hi> minde of this thing. But nowe following the interpretation which we haue alreadye begon, which is of thoſe which ſay, that <hi>Gideon</hi> made this, to remaine as a ſigne and monument of the benefite of God geuen vnto the Hebrues, this I iudge is to be added, that the vulgare men began to haue in admiration the ſigne which was ſet vp, and as they wer prone to ſuperſtitions, they iorneyed thither, and offred peace offringes there, whych thing was a ruine and ſnare vnto them: for by title and litle they fel into idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Neither was <hi>Gideon</hi> without blame. For he erected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> monument, &amp; abuſed the ſigne: &amp; when he ſaw how the people fel, yet tooke he not away that monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather winked at it. <hi>Ezechias</hi> afterward did more rightly, who when he ſaw the people offer inſence vnto the braſen ſerpent, he brake it downe. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Rabbines</hi> labour to excuſe <hi>Gideon,</hi> bycauſe wyth a good mynde he cauſed the Ephod or monument of the benefite of God to bee made, but the Iſraelites miſuſed it.

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> intreating of this place,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> thinketh that the figure of <hi>Synechdoche</hi> is here to be vnderſtand, ſo that by this word Ephod, al prieſtly ornamentes may be noted, as though <hi>Gideon</hi> would in his Citye haue an holye miniſtery: which was plainly againſt the wil of God, who had appointed to be worſhipped at the Arke of the couenant. That was no other thing, then to plucke away men from the tabernacle of God, &amp; after a ſort to deuide the church. <hi>Gideon</hi> &amp; the people did not (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) ſacrifice vnto idols, but with theſe garmentes they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a worſhipping vnto the true God in <hi>Gideon</hi> his houſe, that is in <hi>Ophra.</hi> But foraſmuch as they did otherwiſe then God had preſcribed, they fell therfore into a certaine kinde of Idolatry. And that <hi>Gideon</hi> worſhipped not idols, it doth not onely hereby appeare, in that he ouerthrew the altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> cut downe his groue, and offred vpon the alter of God, the bullocke conſecrated vnto <hi>Baal,</hi> but alſo bicauſe the people al his life time (as we ſhal ſtraightwaye heare) are ſayde not to haue woorſhipped <hi>Baal.</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Auguſtines</hi> opinion is, that <hi>Gideon</hi> would haue had God worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſo in his country, that the ſame thynges might ther haue bene done, which were done in <hi>Silo,</hi> where the Arke was. Which opinion, although it can not be confuted by the ſcriptures, yet it appeareth not very lykelye: For we reade not that he had Prieſtes with him. Neither doo the Hebrue Doctors (who otherwiſe are diligent in expreſſing of thinges done) attribut theſe thinges vnto him, but rather agree with the other ſentence, namely that he conſtituted it for a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the victory which he had obtained, which afterward was an occaſion of ſuperſtition. Wherefore it ſemeth to be ſpoken more probably, that this erected ſigne was had in admiration of the fooliſhe people, ſo that they thought it to be a place very meete to doo ſacrifice there, and eſpeciallye for the offring of peace offeringes vnto the true God, which ſeemed not woorthy of reprouing. For at that time it was lawfull to doo that in a maner euerye where, but ſuperſtition dayly creeping more abroade, they began to attribute more then was meete vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſigne, as to a thing deuine, and which had in it ſome power of God, and for that cauſe they offred ſacrifices, and did incenſe vnto it, keping neuertheles a pretence of the worſhipping of God, and the name of God the Lorde, as in the time of <hi>Ezechias</hi> they did incenſe and ſacrifice vnto the braſen ſerpent.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Whence came the begynnyng of reliques and inuocation of the dead.</note>And in the ſame maner we rede happened at the beginning of the ſepulchers, bones, and reliques of holye men. The Chriſtians buried the dead bodies of the Martirs, as honorablye as they coulde, and to haue the memorye of them kept, they began to haue places of prayer at their tombes, not vndoubtedlye where they would woorſhip and inuocate the Martirs, but where they might heare the woord of God, receaue the Sacramentes, and exhorte one an other to defende the faith. And in deede that place ſeemed not a litle commodious for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For the ſepulchres of Martirs ſeemed to admoniſh &amp; inflame the myndes, to enterpriſe the ſame battailes, and to behaue them ſelues moſt conſtantly for the name of Chriſt. Wherfore it was thought that in aſſembling to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of Martirs, two commodities were gotten. Firſt, bicauſe ſome honour might be geuen to ſo great Confeſſors, whileſt the memory of them was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fered to be forgotten, but with verye great ioy thankes were geuen vnto God for their happy victory. The other was, bicauſe men might bee ſtirred vp to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe the like,<note place="margin">The beginning of the images of Sayntes.</note> and to hope for the like gifts at Gods hand. And after the ſame maner began the images of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles priuatelye to bee made, namely that their death, which ſemed vnto the world full of ignominye, myght be made more honorable, and that the memory of them might flooriſhe, and by beholding of thoſe images ſo ſet vp, men might be prouoked to the iuſt and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable imitacion of them. If the thing had abidden within theſe bondes, it might haue bene borne with al, neither was there any thing there which might iuſtly be condemned: but euen as the act of <hi>Gideon</hi> was turned at the length to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo in ſucceſſe of tyme folowed the inuocation of Martirs at their ſepulchers, and the images of ſaintes began to be ſet vp and woorſhipped, not onely in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate places, but alſo in temples.</p>
                  <p>The act of <hi>Gideon</hi> was <hi>a ſnare to him, and to his houſe,</hi> for both hee ſynned, and his children (as we ſhal heare) were horribly ſlayne.

But what godlye mocion coulde it be, which Chriſt reproued, yea and ſo reproued it, that he affirmed that he which ſo drewe the ſwoorde, ſhould periſhe with the ſwoorde? What other thing was this, then to haue a zeale of God, but (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth) not accordyng to knowledge. <hi>Paule</hi> alſo the Apoſtle, when he afflicted and deſtroied the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, thought that he dyd God high ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges haue a ſhewe of a good intent (as they call it) or of godlynes, but they are not in very deede that which they ſhewe for. Euen ſo encreaſed the pompe of the Maſſe, by no other meanes, then by a ſhewe of a good intent. For it ſeemed good vnto our Elders to adorne the Supper of the Lord. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Pope added this thing, and an other that thing, ſo that at the lengthe the thyng came to thys poynte, that theſe additions excluded the inſtitution of Chriſt, in ſuch ſorte that it may ſeme to be any other thing els, then the Supper of the Lord, for thoſe thynges are obſerued which men haue inuented: but that which Chriſt willed, namelye that brethren ſhould communicate together, and celebrate the memory of his death, this I ſay is aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>But why the woorſhippinges inſtituted by mans inuention are to bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, this is an aſſured reaſon:<note place="margin">Why worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings inuented by man, are to be abiected.</note> bycauſe in woorſhipping of God we muſt do all thinges chiefely throughe fayth, but it is of no force if it want the word of God. Wherefore if rites which are retayned for the woorſhipping of God, lacke hys woorde, faith may not be geuen vnto them, and therfore ar they rather ſynnes, then woorkes pleaſing God.

They wil not deny it I ſuppoſe: when as hee was of God appointed to be the highe Prieſt, and the fellowe of <hi>Moſes</hi> in woorking of miracles. And yet for all that either of them, when they inſtituted a woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping without the woord of God, are greuouſly accuſed by the holye Scriptures. Let them therefore ceaſe to obtrude vnto vs the Saintes: but when we require the woord of God, if they wil that we ſhould beleue them, let them bring foorth the holy ſcriptures. We know that rites and worſhippinges inſtituted euen by God himſelfe, are not acceptable vnto him, when they are done without fayth, as <hi>Eſay, Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> moſt manifeſtly teache, howe muche leſſe wyll hee receaue thoſe thinges which are inuented of men, whiche for that they are not grounded on his woord, doo vtterly want fayth?</p>

                  <head>¶Of a good Intent.</head>
                  <p>BVt bycauſe there is ſomething alledged of a good Intent, whereby ſome go about to excuſe <hi>Gideon,</hi> I thinke it good briefelye to touche thoſe thynges, which are neceſſary, as concerning it.</p>
                  <p>As touching the ſignification of the woorde, Intent ſignifieth a motion of the mynde, whereby by ſome meane we tende vnto an ende, as if a man ſhoulde ſtudy by geuing of gifts or by ſeruices to attain vnto any honor. For the nature of thinges is in ſuch ſort, that many thinges are ſo connexed together betwene themſelues, that by the one is made a ſteppe vnto the other. For by medecines &amp; drinkes we attaine vnto health: by ſtudies, reading, &amp; teachers, vnto wiſdome.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:159"/> Wherfore an intent is an action of the wil, for it is his office to moue and ſtirre vp the mynde. And foraſmuch as the wyl doth not perceaue the thinges that he deſireth, before that it hath the knowledge thereof, it moueth not, nor forceth the minde before knowledge, which raygneth in the power of intelligence or vnderſtanding. It perceaueth both the end, and thoſe things which ſerue to the end, and miniſtreth them vnto the wyl. Therfore Intent ſtirreth vp to the end, as to a terme,<note place="margin">The definition of an intent.</note> by thoſe thinges which vnto it are directed. Let this be his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A wyl tending vnto the ende by ſome meanes. Wyl, which is his generall woord, is an act of the power that wylleth. The differrence is taken of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, namely of the ende, and theſe thinges which are ordeined vnto it: as nowe as touching <hi>Gideon,</hi> his intent was a motion of his wyll, to keepe the memory of the victory geuen him, by the Ephod which he had made. In will therefore he comprehended at once both the end and the meane.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">There is bothe a good intent &amp; an euyll.</note>An Intent in deuided into a good intent and an euyll. And to a good intent this is chiefely required, that the ende be a thing iuſt and good: which yet is not ſufficient. For if a man ſhould ſteale to geue almes, he vndoubtedlye ſhoulde ſet before his eyes a good thing, but bycauſe the meane is euyll, therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent can not be called good. But if the ende bee both vnlawfull and euyll, then ſhall the intent alſo be euyll. Wherefore that the intent be good, both the ende and the meane muſt be honeſt and good thinges. Howbeit certayne thinges are by theyr nature ſo euyll, that we can neuer vſe them rightly. As theft, periury, adulterye,<note place="margin">An euill intent of two kyndes.</note> and ſuche lyke. Wherefore the Apoſtles rule muſt alwayes be firme, that wee muſt neuer doo euyll thinges, whereby good thynges maye followe. Therefore an euyll intent is two maner of wayes: that is, eyther by the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyneſſe of the ende,<note place="margin">Twoo thinges are required in a good intent.</note> or els of the meanes. But the intent can neuer bee good, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept bothe ende and meane be good. Thus farre the Philoſophers and ſchoole Deuines agree wyth vs. Nowe muſt we ſee wherein they differ from vs.</p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers doo thinke that the righteouſnes of the ende and meanes dependeth of humane reaſon or naturall vnderſtanding, as though it were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to put a difference betwene iuſt thinges and vniuſt: but that we denye, and requyre fully fayth and the woorde of God,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> as ſure rules, whych thyng <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> teſtifieth in many places, and eſpeciallye vpon the .xxxi. Pſalme, where he ſayth: Doo not count thy woorkes good before faythe, whyche are nothyng els, then (as me thynketh) great ſtrengthes, and a moſt ſwyft courſe out of the waye, and he which ſo maketh haſte, runneth headlong to deſtruction: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good intent maketh a good action,<note place="margin">Faith directeth the intent.</note> but fayth directeth the intent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt take heede, when we purpoſe any woorke, that our hart haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde vnto fayth, whereby it may direct his endeuours.</p>
                  <p>The ſchoole Deuines wyll eaſelye graunt that fayth gouerneth the intent, and maketh it good. But we differ from them for three cauſes. Fyrſt, bicauſe we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> affirme that faith dependeth onely of the woorde of God: but they wyll haue it to leane vnto Fathers and Counſels,<note place="margin">Faith muſt not cleaue vnto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels</note> and that in no caſe maye be graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, foraſmuche as fayth muſt bee conſtant, and vtterlye without errour: whych twoo thynges are not founde in the Fathers and Counſels, bicauſe they ſpeake thinges one contrary to an other. Fathers very often ſtryue wyth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Counſels are againſt Counſels: and thoſe Fathers are rare, yea in a maner none, whych haue not ſometyme erred, and that in thinges moſt waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and very many Counſels haue neede of amendement. Doth not the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by expreſſe woordes teſtify that all men are lyers?</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other thing, wherein wee can not aſſent vnto the Schoolemen, is, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by a good intent they affirme that our woorkes are made meritorious, yea and that of eternall lyfe. Which thing how farre of it is from the truth, the nature of merite may teache vs: whereof I mynde not nowe to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The thyrde thing wherein we differ from the Schoolemen is, bycauſe they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18396:159"/> wyl haue the worke to be made good by an habitual good entent as they ſpeke:<note place="margin">The habitual entent of the Scholemen.</note> That is to ſaye, done without any good mocion of the hart. They fayn that our actions do pleaſe god, as prayers, reading of Pſalmes, and geuing of Almes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in act we thinke nothing of God, &amp; they ſuppoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys habitual entent which they place in him, is ſufficient inough. So that if thou ſhouldſt demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of him, whych doth theſe thyngs, why he doth ſo? he may be redy to aunſwer, that he doth it to the glory of god, eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in doing of it he hath not a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary mind or repugnant will. But this can we not graunt vnto them, for aſmuch as in this negligence, wherby when we work we think not of god nor of his glory, the commaundement of god is violated, which commaundeth vs to loue god withall the hart, withall the ſoule, and withall the ſtrengthes. Wherfore we ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther counſell that this maye bee knowleged a ſynne, then to be counted a good woorke.</p>
                  <p>But bicauſe they perceiued that theyr ſayinges haue ſome abſurdity, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo that in the beginninge of that woorke, we thinke ſomewhat of god and his glory, and ſo that that which is purpoſed, be directed vnto hym. But no man doubteth but that the begynning of all thoſe thinges whiche we do, oughte to be good: but afterward, if fayth follow not thoſe thinges whyche we haue well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne, and if when we are working, we haue not a reſpect vnto god and his glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, we ſhall runne hedlonge into ſinne, which may not be diſſembled.

Wherfore ſo long as we deſiſt from thinkinge vpon the honor and glory of God, we fall, neyther are ſuch falles to be diſſembled, but rather to pray that they may be turned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, foraſmuch as of their own nature they are ſinnes,<note place="margin">Fayth is not ſufficient in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And if thyne eye be ſymple, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body ſhal be lyght.

And in like maner writeth he in his .10. Tome, the .2. Sermon, where he entreateth vpon this place, we muſt not do righteouſnes before men, to be ſeene of them. The intent (ſaith he) is alwayes to be applied vnto the glory of God, but the wyll to haue it knowen vnto men, is to be auoyded, but ſo much as ſhall ſeme to pertayne to the honour of God. And to that tendeth that whych Chriſt ſpeaketh: A good tree cannot bringe forth euel frutes, neither an euil tre, good: for as much as the tree ſignifieth the entent. Wherfore this act of <hi>Gideon</hi> done of a good intent (if thoſe thinges be true whyche we haue ſayde) cannot be excuſed, when as fayth gouerned it not.</p>

                     </note> we can not ſe how that hauing of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine differeth from it. Matrimony, mariages, wedding, and wedlocke ſygnify al one thing. And Matrimony (as it is had in the .i. boke <hi>Inſt.

But this diffinicion muſte be perfected by the holy ſcriptures. Wherfore we muſt adde, that this coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man and woman was inſtituted by god, for the bringing forth of children, for the taking away of whoredome, &amp; that therby humayne life might haue helpes and commodityes. In this difinicion vndoubtedlye the coniunction of man and woman holdeth place in the matter. The inſeperable conuerſation of life pertai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth vnto the forme, for with this purpoſe and will man and wife muſte marye together. For though by adultery that copulation be taken away, yet when the matrimony is contract, they ought both of them to haue this in theyr mind, that beyng once ioyned they muſt abide &amp; liue together. This belongeth alſo to the forme, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of gods law and mans law be had betwene them.

As touching the firſt hauing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines, was by the ciuile law a certayne kind of matrimony: for a concubine was not a harlot,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Hauyng of a Concubine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maynes to be a kind of Matri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony.</p>

And how much it differeth from a wife, it ſhall appeare by the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a concubine. For a concubine is ſhe which hath the vſe of mariage wyth one that liueth ſole. But for that ſhee is not vnſeperable, (bycauſe they that are ſo ioyned maye eaſely be ſeperated) therefore a concubine differeth muche from a very wife: Farther humayn rights ar not communicated with her, for a Concu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bine goeth not into the famely of him with whome ſhee is conuerſant. Yea and theyr goodes and facultyes are not commune together, neyther are the children borne of that coniunction, counted lawful and iuſt heyres, vnleſſe they be made legitimate by the benefyte of the prince. Howbeit it is by the Romayne law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden that a manne ſhoulde haue manye Concubines at once, and it is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to haue a Concubyne together with his wife. Moreouer by the Romayne lawes, ſuch can not be counted as Concubynes, whych may be vſed as harlots, as a fre virgine, and a widow vnder .25. yeres of age: for if a man medle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, eyther it ſhalbe matrimony, or els iudged whoredome. Howbeit a widow maye be a Concubin, if before witneſſes it be declared, that ſhe is taken not for a wife, but for a Concubine. And laſtly there can be no Concubine, whiche may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a wife, although not in that place where ſhe dwelleth, yet at the leaſt in an other place, which I therfore ad, becauſe by the Romaine law it was not lawful for the Preſident to mary a wife of that prouince wher he gouerned, whiche yet he might haue as a Concubine.</p>
                  <p>And if thou wilt demaund, whether the Romayne law allowed Concubines
<pb facs="tcp:18396:161"/> or no.<note place="margin">Whether the Romaine lawe allowed concu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bines or no.</note> I wyll anſwer, that they did abſolutely allow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, not hauynge of Concubines as a thing vnlawfull, ſo that it were vſed as before is ſayd. Yet it ſhadowingly reproueth that coniunction, when as it ſuffreth not the children borne of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines to be lawful &amp; iuſt heyres, vnleſſe at the length of a Concubine ſhe ſhould become a wife, or vnleſſe it be by the authority of the prince. Howbeit we muſt know that the children of a Concubyne, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto a certayne little portion of inheritance, but yet not to a like and equall portion with the legitimate. Yea and the children borne of a concubyne, are not in the power of the father. But when of a Concubine ſhe is made a wife, then it was neceſſary that there ſhoulde be tables of Matrimony.</p>
                  <p>If we will retayne the Romayn law, a handmayden cannot be made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine: for by that law a handmayden could not be made a wife. For the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a free man with a hand maiden, the Romayn lawes called <hi>Contuberniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> neyther did they count it for a iuſt matrimonye. Howbeit by handemaydens the Romaynes vnderſtode not hired ſeruantes, but ſuch as were bought: whiche I therefore ſpeake, becauſe our hired handemaydens, are free perſons, and therfore it is lawfull to contracte iuſt matrimony with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were wiues.</note>But now let vs conſider of the law of the Hebrewes, &amp; what is to be thought of the Concubines of the fathers. They wer in very dede wiues, although often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were handemaydens, as <hi>Agar, Bala, Zilpa,</hi> and as this Concubine of <hi>Gideon.</hi> In the iudgement ſeate, and as touching ciuile actions, it ſeemeth that free men of thoſe places where theſe fathers were conuerſant, could not contract matrimony with them, and therfore paraduenture in holy ſcriptures they were called Concubines. But yet before god, that is by the law of matrimony inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituted by hym, they were wyues. Wherfore in the boke of Geneſis <hi>Agar</hi> whyche is called a Concubine, is alſo called a wife. Therefore there were two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene the Hebrewe lawes and the Romayne lawes: bycauſe wyth them hauinge of Concubines was no matrimony, but with the Iewes it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: although openlye and by ciuill reaſon, bycauſe of the ſeruile condicion of the woman, ſhee was not acknowledged peraduenture for a wyfe. Farther, herein they differ, bicauſe the Iewes had handmaydens to theyr Concubynes: &amp; the ſame was not lawfull for the Romaynes, if we followe that lawe, that ſhee ſhould be a Concubine, which may be made a wife. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Romayne lawes counted not that for matrimony, which was contracted with a handmayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But this ciuill law was not in <hi>Ieromes</hi> tyme retayned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayn Empire,<note place="margin">Ierome</note> eyther becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eccleſiaſtical canons had mitigated it, or els for ſome other cauſe. For in hys Epiſtle to <hi>Oceanus,</hi> he ſpeaketh of certayne, whyche had theyr handmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in ſteede of wiues, for this cauſe not callinge them by the name of wyues, to auoide burthens, and charges, who yet if they became rich, made theyr hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maydens wiues.<note place="margin">After what ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner the decrees permit Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</note> But we muſt know moreouer, that where Concubines ſeeme to be allowed and permitted in the decrees, the ſame is to be vnderſtand of thoſe which are in very deede wiues, although by the Romayn lawes and ciuily they were counted for Concubines, bicauſe that woman was not ſolemply maried, al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though there was a mutuall conſent betwene them of matrimony.

                  <p>But they ſay, he fell into ſuperſtitions.

To this I aunſwere, it might be (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) that this ſuperſtition began toward the latter end of his life, which thing, being repentaunt, he had decreed to take away if he had liued.

So alſo among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayns <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> by an Apology wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the people, which wer departed, to adioine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues agayn to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <p>The fable of <hi>Eſope</hi> of the frogges which deſired a kinge, differeth not muche from this Apology which we ar now in hand with: for to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the beame or poſt which they diſpiſed, was geuen a drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which by litle &amp; litle eat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp al.</p>
                  <p>And I wil begyn at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> declaration of the fable wherin it is ſaid: <hi>If ye haue done rightly and orderly, reioyſe with Abimelech, and Abimelech with you. But if not, let a fire come out from him, &amp; conſume you.</hi> The oliue tree, vine tree, &amp; fyg tree is the famelye of <hi>Gideon:</hi> and the trees which deſire a king are the Sechemites.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:167"/> And as among trees there are ſome noble and ſome abiect: ſo alſo amonge men there ar ſome noble and excellent, and ſome vnnoble and of no reputacion. The bramble brier ſignifieth <hi>Abimelech.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble or briar. <hi>Plini.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Plini</hi> in his 24. booke and .14. chapt. writeth of this kind of thorn. And as touching this matter, theſe are the properties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: it is a plant vile and abiect, as was <hi>Abimelech,</hi> who was a baſtard and borne of a hand mayd, ſo that he was not to be compared with his brethern. And as he without any vtility gouerned the Iſraelites, ſo is the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble wont to bringforth no frute. The bramble alſo pricketh, euen as <hi>Abimelech</hi> very muche hurted the Iſraelites. Moreouer ſome write that the bowes of brambles are ſometimes ſo vehemently ſhaken and moued with the winde, that out of them is fire kindled, wherewith not only they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues burn, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole wood wherin they grow is burnte: which thinge <hi>Iotham</hi> nowe foretelleth to come to paſſe of <hi>Abimelech.</hi> Wherfore the properties do wonderfully well agree.</p>
                  <p>But here are twoo queſtions offred vnto the readers. The fyrſt is, bycauſe it is ſaid that the trees wente to the Oliue tree, vine tree, figge tree, and bramble, to create them a king, when as the Sechemites went not vnto <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and vnto the ſonnes of <hi>Gideon,</hi> but rather <hi>Abimelech</hi> wente vnto them. The other is, wee do not here reade that the ſonnes of <hi>Gideon</hi> refuſed the kingdome offred vnto them, or aunſwered thoſe thinges which the trees ſayd, when they were called to raygne.</p>
                  <p>The latter queſtion I thinke may be diſſolued two wayes, ſayinge, that the ſonnes of <hi>Gideon</hi> in dede anſwered not ſo: but they would haue anſwered ſo, if they had beene demaunded. Wherefore <hi>Iotham</hi> knowyng ſo rightwell al their mindes and wyll, ſeemeth not to ſpeake ſo muche from the purpoſe. Or els we may ſay, that <hi>Gideon</hi> hymſelf aunſwered for his ſonnes, when he ſaid: I wil not reygne ouer you, God himſelf ſhall raygne ouer you, And that we maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what the three noble trees ment by theyr aunſweres, this is to be called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to remembrance, that the kingdome was offred vnto <hi>Gideon,</hi> not onelye for himſelfe, but alſo for his ſonne, and ſonnes ſonne. Wherefore he refuſed the kingdome for three. And hereof it commeth (as the Rabbines ſuppoſe) that ther are three kindes of trees brought in.</p>
                  <p>But as touchinge the firſt queſtion, the Sechemites and Iſraelites came not vnto <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to make him theyr kinge, but yet the holy ghoſte ſo ſpeaketh by <hi>Iotham,</hi> bicauſe he is he that knoweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harts, &amp; knew that that people labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this deſire to haue at the length a king. For they had manifeſtly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it before, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they offred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome vnto <hi>Gideon,</hi> &amp; afterwarde more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtlye they ſhewed it in the time of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when they altogether deſired to haue a king geuen them, as other nacions had.</p>

                     </note>Out of this Apology is drawen an argument of thinges compared together.

For as theſe men faine for themſelues, that the Church ſhoulde be rightlier go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by one, namely the Biſhop of Rome, then by many Biſhops, of whyche euery one fully ſhould haue care, as touching his owne portion: So myght the Iewes haue alledged, that their kingdome ſhoulde be farre better gouerned by one, then by many.

                  <p>But it is meete to conſider what the profitable and fruitful trees anſwered when they were required to take vpon them a kingdome.<note place="margin">Holy men wyl not be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue other men.</note> They ſaide they were content with their own good thinges: and therefore they would neither receaue a kingdome, or ſuffer anye alteration of their ſtate.

Neither is it to be doubted, but that this kinde of dronkennes is vtterly to be auoided. Of the firſt kinde of dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which is Methaphorical, there is plaine mencion made in the Prouerbs of <hi>Salomon,</hi> where wyſedome ſtirreth vp men to drinke wine, whiche ſhe hath ſet foorth on her table, plentifully and aboundantly.

And <hi>Paul</hi> twiſe commaundeth that the Miniſters of the Church ſhould not be geuen to much wine. And when he counſelled his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe</hi> to vſe wyne for the ſtomake and diſeaſes, he addeth that it ſhould be but a litle, leaſt he ſhould let loſe the bridle to dronkennes. In the olde law alſo the vſe of wyne was forbidden the <hi>Nazarites:</hi> and the <hi>Rechabites</hi> are in <hi>Ieremy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mended, bicauſe at their fathers commaundement they abſtained from wyne: at which time yet they knew that theſe thinges were written, which nowe in the hiſtory we haue in hand, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning wine, namely that with it both God and men ar made mery, and that alſo which is written in the .104. Pſalme, that wine maketh mery the hartes of men. Wherfore let vs gather that theſe are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to vſe wine temperatly and moderatly, and that it was geuen of God, to make vs mery in a due time, and in a right vſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tymes wherin myrthe is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note>Neither ought we to be ignoraunt of this, that ſome ſuche tymes chaunce, wherein it is not meete for Chriſtian &amp; godly men to geue them ſelues to mirth: ſometimes we muſt mourne for the ſynnes which we haue committed. And ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times we are troubled with very grieuous miſeries: and when we are vnder the hand of the rod of God, we muſt pray more vehemently, wherunto faſtings and chaſtning of the body much helpeth: which thing <hi>Paul</hi> declareth in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vnto the <hi>Corrinthians,</hi> when he ſaith, that it is lawful ſomtimes for the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife to depart one from an other for a ſeaſon, but yet with the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſent of them both, that they may geue themſelues to faſtings and praiers: although we muſt not for ſuch abſtinence appoint any certain dayes of the yere, but leaue the time to the prudence of the ſpirite. Howbeit this reaſon maketh much againſt thoſe, which contend that we muſt continually drinke, that at no time we may want mirth. Yea and the ſame Apoſtle ſayd of him ſelfe: I chaſten my body, and bring it in to bondage. By which ſaying he admoniſhed the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> by his example to bridle the luſtes. Ther might be manye more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples rehearſed out of the holy ſcriptures, manifeſtly to declare, that both dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, and alſo to much vſe of wyne are prohibited.

                     <hi>Plato</hi> in his .7. booke <hi>de Legibus,</hi> toward the ende writeth, that <hi>Minos</hi> by his lawes prohibited the <hi>Cretenſes,</hi> that they ſhoulde not drinke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dronkennes. And <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith in his .84. Epiſtle: Dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes is nothing els then a voluntary madnes. And ſtraight way after: The quality of dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes continuing many daies, is furiouſnes. Moreouer, they which ſtriue wyth cuppes, although they ouercome other in taking much wine, yet wil they or nyl they, they are ouercome of the tonnes. And it is filthy for a man to take in more then he is able to receaue, and not to know the meaſure of his ſtomake.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we haue ſufficiently declared, that the abuſe of wine is both againſt the holy ſcriptures, and alſo humane reaſon. Now let vs proue the ſame by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: that they which wil not beleue by the ſentences before alledged, maye yet at the leaſt be taught by theſe examples. <hi>Noah</hi> a great man, iuſt, and loued of God,<note place="margin">The dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Noah.</note> who ſaw two conſtitutions of the world (for he liued both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flood) is ſet foorth vnto vs, as an example vtterly to auoid dronkennes, when as he hauing droonke more wyne then was meete, laye in the tabernacle moſt filthely naked, and his priuy partes, which wer wont to be couered, he left
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18396:169"/> bare and vncouered: and he which was wont to bee a ſchoolemaſter of vertues, was a great offence vnto his children. <hi>Cham</hi> mocked him: the other two ſonnes of a better and holier nature, were ſory, and very much aſhamed of their fathers filthines. By this act it is ſufficiently declared, that ſhame, deriſion, and offence follow dronkennes.</p>
                  <p>But of thys ſynne wee haue a notable example in <hi>Lot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Lot.</note> who vndoubtedlye dranke not immoderately, to the end he would abuſe his daughters, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit inceſt, but to put away cares and griefes which hee had taken, for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the .v. Cities, for the loſſe of his deare wyfe, and alſo of his ſubſtaunce. Hee woulde alſo comforte hys Daughters, that they ſhoulde not take to muche thought, ſpecially for the loſſe of their mother: although he ought to haue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other wayes of comforting. But this I ſpeake onely, leaſt any man ſhoulde thinke that he did with his will drinke to muche, to pollute him ſelfe with moſt fylthy luſtes: Yet for all that, to muche aboundaunce of drinke was the cauſe of hys moſt vyle inceſt, being otherwyſe an olde man, and in a tyme farre oute of purpoſe, for aſmuche as the iudgementes of God were declared agaynſte the fylthy luſtes of the fyue Cities. And which is wonderfull, wyne ſo alienated <hi>Lot</hi> from hym ſelfe, that he vnderſtoode not with what women hee had companyed. Wherfore rightly ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi> in his .84. Epiſtle before alledged:<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> They whych are droonke doo many thinges, which afterward when they are ſober, they are aſhamed of. <hi>Lot</hi> ſought to make hym ſelfe mery by wine, and he incurred a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall heauynes. Let them therefore which ſeeke to be made mery with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche wyne, remember that they put them ſelues in to a moſte preſent daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and by that meanes may eaſely throw them ſelues headlong into moſt gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous wycked actes.</p>
                  <p>Neither is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be allowed which ſome alledge for an excuſe, that ſuch euents are vncertaine, ſo that a man cannot tel for certain, whether he which drinketh to much ſhal fal into theſe filthy thinges or no: bicauſe the thing is ſo ſurely kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen, that euen the daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> being yet virgins, vnderſtoode it, namelye that the olde man by wyne, might be driuen to fylthye luſt, and ſo be deceaued, that alſo he had to doo euen with his daughters. Who wil therfore ſay that he knoweth not that which they vnderſtoode? <hi>Lot</hi> was deceaued and ſnared by his daughters, but ſuch as loue to muche mirth, that is, dronken men, ſnare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; openly fight againſt them ſelues.<note place="margin">God puniſheth dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe bibbers are wont ſomtimes to bring forth <hi>Lot</hi> as a patrone of their intemperance, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo they marke, that the holy ſcriptures do ſet foorth the hiſtorye of him as an horrible, and in a maner tragical example. God did not meanely puniſh that mans dronkennes: for he had to doo with his daughters, they conceaued by him, and the thing coulde not bee diſſembled: inceſtious chyldren were borne, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> of whom came the Nations of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> which were both hated of God, and enemyes vnto the Iſraelites. <hi>Lot</hi> him ſelfe (as it is to be thought) was alwayes ſory for the crime which he had committed, and was talked of, of euerye man.</p>
                  <p>And ſeyng that the teſtimony of the holy Scriptures is extant, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne vnto the ende of the world: as often as they are red, ſo often is noted and ſpreade abroade hys infamy.

Theſe ſhould haue imitated theſe good and honeſt ſtudies.</p>
                  <p>But let vs go on in rehearſing examples. <hi>Ammon Dauids</hi> ſonne was ſlayne of <hi>Abſalon,</hi> not aſſuredly when he was ſober, but when in the banket hee was more mery then was meete, by drinking of to much wyne. And as it is declared in the latter end of the .1. boke of <hi>Machab. Simon</hi> the high prieſt was with his .2. ſonnes <hi>Mattathias</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> ſlayne of his ſonne in law, when in the feaſt they wer in a maner dronken with ouermuch wine. And the hiſtory of <hi>Iudith</hi> (although it be not found in the Canon of the Iewes) ſheweth that <hi>Holofernus,</hi> otherwyſe a moſt fierce Captain of an hoſt, was ſo ouerwhelmed with wine, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſmal a doo he was behedded of a woman. I might adde how <hi>Siſera</hi> being dronken, was ſlaine of <hi>Iahel,</hi> although his drinke was milke, and not wine.</p>
                  <p>And if that we wyl beſides theſe reade ouer the hiſtories of the Ethnikes, we ſhal finde many and notable examples of thoſe, which wer moſt grieuouſly hurt by dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes.<note place="margin">Alexander of Macedonia.</note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the Conqueror of the world, was moſt filthely ouercome with wine, and being dronke, ſlew <hi>Clitus</hi> his friend, moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and faithful, whoſe diligence, induſtry, labour, prudence, and ſtrength, he had in warres long time vſed, to his great commodity. Wherfore when he had ſlept after his wine, and being awaked, and remembring the wicked act that he had committed, he was ſo aſhamed and ſory, that he wiſhed himſelfe dead. But yet he amended not the vice of dronkennes: yea once afterwarde hee droonke ſo much wine in one night, that he fel into a feuer, and for that he would not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himſelfe from wine, within a while after he died. Wherefore <hi>Seneca</hi> in his 84. Epiſtle already alledged, writeth that <hi>Alexander,</hi> which had eſcaped ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daungers, and vanquiſhed thinges moſt dificile, by intemperaunce of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,<note place="margin">M.

For the ſmoothe and plaine ground is vnto dronkardes a denne: for they fall, breake their legges, their armes, and ſometimes their neckes: and are burnt when they fall into the fyre. The liuer is inflamed with to much drynke,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18396:170"/> the head is pained, the members are made weake and tremble, the ſenſes ar cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the natural heate is ouerwhelmed with ouermuche wyne, the ſtomake which is ouer largely diſtended, is ſicke with crudity or rawnes, and with intol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lerable paines: the whole body is in a maner inflamed, and the thirſt is augmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes. <hi>Eſay</hi> in his .v. chapter, agreeth with <hi>Salomon:</hi> For he alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay 5.</note> wo vnto thoſe which are mighty and ſtrong to drinke wine.

But dronkardes are not by theſe cryes ſtirred vp, for they do not onely ſleepe, but ſeme to be in a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner buryed.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18396:171"/> Yea, whileſt they are in their dronken fury, they handle their innocent wife and children euilly, and defraude the poore of their almes, whiche if they lyued more ſparingly, they might be able to beſtow vpon them. They make them ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for the publike wealth, when as dronkardes can neither execute the office of a Magiſtrate them ſelues, nor yet wel ar they able to obey thoſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne.

For <hi>Paul</hi> in the .1. to the <hi>Corrin.</hi> the .5. chap. nombreth dronkardes with thoſe, with whom we ought not ſo much as to eate. There is ſcarce anye euyll which cannot be adioyned vnto the effectes of dronkennes.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude the matter,<note place="margin">An aunſwer to thoſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ouermuch drinkyng.</note> firſt we graunt vnto thoſe (which doo naughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſurpe this place which we haue nowe in hand, and lay it for a coulour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the vice of dronkennes) that it is lawful to vſe wine for neceſſity, for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and alſo for mirth, but yet it muſt be tempered with ſobriety, neither maye it excede a meane, yea it muſt agree with time, place, degree, age, and kinde. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner let the ſaintes reioyce before their God, namely with geuing of thankes, and celebrating diuine prayſes. Neither <hi>Salomon</hi> in the .23. chapter of the Prouerbs, ſaith wo vnto thoſe which drink wine, but vnto thoſe which in it conſume their time, which geue them ſelues to nothing but to drinking, conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding who can drynke moſte, prouoking one an other, and compelling others to drinke. Theſe are reprehended, and not thoſe whiche modeſtlye vſe the gyft of God. Let men ſo make them ſelues mery with wine, that afterward they maye be more chereful to obey God, and to ſuffer heauy thinges, if neede bee. And let men beware they forget not them ſelues, that they ouerwhelme not their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and choke vp their ſtrength. Neither is the holy ſcripture vngodlye and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to be drawen vnto the licence of the fleſh. Yea we ought ſo to bee readye that we may obey the Apoſtle, who ſayd: It is good not to eate fleſh, and not to drinke wine, if it ſhould turne to the offending of the weake brethren. Let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo remember that the kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, neither ar they commended of God, which can drinke more wyne, then the reſt. The woorde of God is no defence for dronkennes, yea it deteſteth it. We wil pleade therfore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, with the doctrine of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the .31. chap. where it is ſaid: ſhew not thy ſelfe a man in wine, that is, ſhew not thy ſtrength in drinking. For ther are ſome which try how ſtrong and mighty they are in this intemperaunce, and alſo with ouermuch drinking of wine, do oppreſſe al the powers, both of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and of the minde. The wiſe man goeth forward and ſayth: for wine hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed many. As the fornace proueth the hardnes of the ſwoorde in the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: ſo doth wine the hartes of the proude when they are dronke. Wine mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately dronken, is profitable for the life of man. What is his lyfe that is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with wine? But it was created to make men mery: Wyne meaſurablye dronken, and in time, brinketh gladnes and cherefulnes of the minde. &amp;c. Theſe thinges may eaſely teache and anſwer thoſe men, which vnder the pretence to make them mery, labour to defend and maintaine dronkennes.</p>
                  <p>Let them conſider with them ſelues, that the gyftes of God ſhoulde neuer be ſeperated from the rule of modeſty and temperaunce. Let them not forget that the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> reckoned dronkennes among the woorkes of the fleſhe. He alſo admoniſhed the <hi>Romanes</hi> that they ſhoulde not be conuerſaunt in Chambers, in eatynges and dronkennes. And to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> he ſheweth the filthineſſe of thys vyce, when he ſayth it pertayneth vnto the nyght. They which are droonke (ſayth he) are dronke in the night: as though he would affirme it to be a thing vnwoorthy, to be ſeene by the light of the day.

                  <p>As touching the firſt, we muſt know, that not euerye murther is condemned. For if one kil a man by chaunce, in exerciſing a thing honeſt and lawful, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth not the puniſhment of Homicides. Wherfore in the old law there were graunted Cities of refuge. For in verye deede he kylleth not: but as it is there written, God (wythout whoſe wyll nothing is done by chaunce) deliuered him to be killed. A Iudge alſo or Magiſtrate, when he puniſheth flagicious men, is not therefore a murtherer, bicauſe it is not he that killeth, but the law, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God himſelfe, who hath wylled, and alſo commaunded that it ſhould ſo be done.

For they are moſte harde to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and I began in a manner to diſpayre, vntill I went into the ſanctuarye of God, and vnderſtood theyr laſt end. For who may not eaſelye be deceiued in the rich man and <hi>Lazarus?</hi> When as the one in mans ſight ſemed to haue bene moſt bleſſed, and the other moſt miſerable. Therfore (ſayth he) it was paynefull vnto me, vntyll I was broughte into the ſanctuary of God, &amp; beheld theyr laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But as touching <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the propheſy ought to be fulfilled whiche <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> pronounced: Let a fire come out of <hi>Abimelech</hi> and deſtroy his enemies.</p>
                  <p>God ſuffreth <hi>Abimelech</hi> to excerciſe his tiranny three yeares, in which ſpace be ſemed to tary for his repentance. But he heaped vp vnto him ſelf angre in the day of anger. For if he had ben wiſe he would eaſly haue thoght thus with him ſelfe after the victory: The <hi>Sechemites</hi> ſinned thoroughe my perſwaſion: if they ar now ſo ſeuerely ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, what ſhalbe be done to me at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth? But he being blinded that he could not ſe theſe thynges, at the laſt was filthily ſlayne. So the vngodly ar dronken with proſperous fortune, and god ſemeth to fede them vp, as ſacrifices, which are firſt fed and fatted, before they be killed. In whiche ſenſe <hi>Eſay</hi> in the .34. chap. writeth: The Lord hath a ſacrifice in <hi>Bozra.</hi> Wherfore <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>melech,</hi> by all the things that he ſaw, is made neuer a whit the better, yea rather he was made the more inſolent, and attempteth other thinges more tirannical. In the boke of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> the 8. chap. it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Bicauſe ſentence agaynſt the euill is not executed ſpedely, the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men do without any feare perpetrate euil thinges. Therfore are men made ſo hedlong to ſinne, bicauſe they abuſe the goodnes of god: &amp; it is ſo far of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vngodly, when he ſeeth an other corrected, ſhould amend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he alwayes beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth worſe &amp; worſe, and alwaies endeuoureth to goe on farther in wickednes. Whiche thinge I woulde to God we woulde follow in vertues and good deedes. <hi>Abimelech</hi> had ouercome the Sechemites, neither was that ſufficient for him: then tooke he the holde, neyther was that y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him: he conquered the citye of <hi>Thebez,</hi> and yet did not this ſuffice him. He will go on farther yet: and is moſt filthyly ſlayne. As concerning the city of <hi>Thebez, Kimhi</hi> ſayth, that it alſo fell from the gouernment of <hi>Abimelech.</hi>

He is at the poynt of death
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18396:178"/> and he vaynelye thinketh vpon glorye: He thinketh it a reproche to be killed of a woman, and is nothinge carefull for the ſoule, nor for the other life: he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye careth for his name and fame.

Wherefore <hi>Iair</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> a man hauing plenty of children: for he had .xxx. And no maruaile, when as then they vſed to haue many wyues. His children was no Raſcals or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, yea they were horſmen: which is thus deſcribed, <hi>which rode vpon</hi> .30. <hi>Aſſe colts.</hi> This Hebrue woord <hi>Air</hi> ſignifieth either a Colt or an Aſſe,<note place="margin">Dauid Kimhi</note> according to which ſence are ſignified .xxx.

Neither were they onely horſmen, but alſo riche: for <hi>they poſſeſſed</hi> .30. <hi>Cities,</hi> bicauſe euery one of them was ruler of a City: wherfore their father muſt nedes be very noble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They were called Hauoth-Iair.</hi> Bicauſe they wer not enuironed with a wall. And were ſo called <hi>euen to this day,</hi> namely euen vnto <hi>Samuels</hi> tyme, who (they ſay) was authour of this booke. In the booke of <hi>Numbers</hi> the .xxxii. chap. it is written, <hi>Iair</hi> tooke many Cities from the <hi>Chananites,</hi> and they were called <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoth-Iair.</hi> Wherefore it is demaunded, whither he were the ſame man of whom we now ſpeake, or whether he were an other? I doo not thinke that he was the ſame, foraſmuch as betwene them both there were .300. yeares paſſed. He was a certaine other man diſtinct from this <hi>Iair,</hi> of whom we nowe ſpeake, but yet hee was of the ſame famely: and paraduenture this was his Neuew, for they which are of the ſame famely, doo for the moſt part retayne the names of their kynred. Vnto this <hi>Iair</hi> came thoſe Cities, whych that other <hi>Iair</hi> tooke from the <hi>Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</hi> Wherfore the places agree: but that it is not the ſame man. This Iudge therefore is noble, when as the twoo former were but of a baſe famely. Neither doth Nobility anything hinder to gouerne a publike wealth, if ſelf truſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence be taken away: yea rather they haue examples of their Elders, excellent ſtirringes vp to vertue, and very many helpes, to gouerne thinges well. And it is not vnlikely but that the people vnder theſe two Iudges, rightly worſhipped God in long and quiet peace, otherwiſe God would not haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſo long a time of reſt. But after them, the Hebrues turned againe vnto Idolatry.</p>

They conſidered that they them ſelues whyche woorſhipped but one God, were fewe in the number, but there was an infinite number which woorſhipped Idoles. And as they deteſted the ceremonies and holye ſeruices of other Nations, ſo on the other ſyde other Nacions bothe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred them, and alſo vexed them with contumelies. Laſtly, the woorſhipping of the true God was more ſeuere, and after a ſort more ſadde, it hadde no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, no chalenging of battayl one with an other, no ſtage playes, no dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cings, no running at tylts, no Comodies, no Tragedies, all which thynges they ſawe were vſed in the woorſhipping of Idoles, yea and alſo often times were added moſt vyle and fylthy thinges.

And for as muche as God hath nowe decreed, that thoſe ceremonies ſhoulde by Chriſt be made of none effect, and they wyl ſtyl keepe them: they doo therin that which ouerthwart wiues are wont to do, when the huſband wyl, they wyl not, when he wyll not, then they again wyll. <hi>They did not onely woorſhip Baal and Aſtharoth, but alſo the Gods of Aram, &amp; Zidon, the Gods of the Moabites, and of

                     <hi>And forſooke the Lord.</hi> They did not onely follow ſtraunge Gods, but alſo forſooke the woorſhipping of the true God.

Farthermore let vs marke, that euen the ſelf ſame yeare, wherin <hi>Iair</hi> died, they were vexed and oppreſſed of their enemies. The Lorde taried not: ſtraightwaye after the death of the Iudge, hee beganne to afflict the people. In whyche place we muſt note, that moſt ſtronge Nations, ſo ſoone as they are deſtitute of God, are eaſelye without anye a doo conquered and ouerthrowne of their enemyes. For it is God onely which geueth power and ſtrength, and therefore the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were ſtraightway oppreſſed of their enemies, bicauſe the Lord had forſaken them: for God is not onely the efficient cauſe of might and rule, but alſo it is he that keepeth and preſerueth it. <hi>They oppreſſed vniuerſally al the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> For they kept not them ſelues within any bondes: but wandred and made rodes through out al the borders of the Hebrues, which thing is noted by theſe woordes: <hi>Yea and they paſſed ouer Iordan.</hi> The tribes of <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">How we muſt vnderſtand the threatnings of God.</note>In like manner is it of threateninges: bicauſe often tymes muſte bee added this condicion: Except ye repent. I ſayde often tymes: bicauſe vniuerſallye it is not true, as it appeareth in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who repented, and yet ſuffered thoſe thinges which <hi>Nathan</hi> threatened. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo repented, and yet came hee not into the promiſed land. And as touching the condicion of repentaunce, we muſt not ouer paſſe this, that it is not perfect in vs: otherwiſe the forgeuenes of ſyns ſhould be due vnto vs as a rewarde: wherefore wee muſt holde this for certaine, that the condicion of repentaunce is Euangelicall, and when there is repentaunce founde in vs, it is a fruite of fayth, and not a merite. Of this thing ryght well wryteth <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in hys .v. Homelye to the people of <hi>Antioche,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> where hee comforteth the people, bicauſe of the threatninges of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> He bringeth a place out of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the .xviii. chapter,<note place="margin">A difference be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene Princes of the worlde &amp; God.</note> and addeth that the ſentence of God is farre otherwiſe, then the ſentence of Princes of this worlde. For the ſentence of a Prince is ſtraightwaye, as ſoone as it is once ſpoken, performed, and can ſcarcely be chaunged: but the ſentence of God, if it haue threatened any thyng, is not headlong vnto deſtruction, nor vntreatable, yea rather it maye ſeeme a degree and a certaine beginning vnto ſaluation. For by this meanes God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes reuoketh ſynners vnto the right waye, and ſaueth them. And thus much as concerning condicions.</p>
                  <p>But as touching time, we muſt not alwaies looke, that God ſhould ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way performe his promiſes. If he deferre it, wee ought thus to comfort our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, he hath not yet accompliſhed, but he will doo it in due tyme. He will in the meane time after this maner exerciſe our faith. God ſeemeth many times to do nothing leſſe, then that which he hath promiſed and threatned. He promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dauid</hi> a kingdome: but by what tribulations did he exerciſe him, before that he accompliſhed his promiſes? For firſt he was poore and a Shepehearde, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being taken into the court, he began to be hated of <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſo endaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there wanted very litle, but that he was almoſt fallen into his power. When our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be borne of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Angell promiſed, that he ſhould haue the throne of <hi>Dauid</hi> his father, and yet till he was thirty yeares of age, he lyued in a maner vnknowen. And then was he odious vnto the high Prieſtes, Phariſeis and Scribes: and was in that ſort long tyme yll handled, and at the length by them crucified. Wherfore <hi>Eſay</hi> very wel admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, that he which beleueth, ſhoulde not make haſte. For God will in due time performe thoſe thinges which hee hath promiſed: but it is our part in the meane time, not to preſcribe any thing vnto him. <hi>Paul</hi> in the .x. to the Hebrues writeth: ye haue neede of pacience, that doing the wyll of God, ye maye obtaine the promiſe. For yet a litle while, and he that ſhall come, wyll come, and wyll not tarye: and the iuſt liueth by faith. But if any withdrawe himſelfe, my ſoule ſhal haue no pleaſure in him. The ſame thing alſo muſt we determine of threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenynges. God ſayde he woulde ouerthrowe the <hi>Babilonians:</hi> but they flooriſhed and triumphed, yea and they led awaye the people of God captiue. Wherefore God would not then accompliſh his threateninges, which yet afterward when he ſaw his time, he performed.</p>
                  <p>Let vs apply theſe thinges vnto our place. What ſayde God? <hi>I wil not helpe you,</hi> that is, at thys preſent: but afterwarde when I ſee oportunitye I wil helpe you. Yea and God oftentimes anſwereth vnto vs alſo inwardly, &amp; in our hart,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18396:182"/> I wil not helpe you: for ye are laden with ſinnes. What ſhal we then doo? ſhall we ceaſe of from prayers? Not ſo. Let vs rather imitate the Hebrues: they, the more ſharpely God anſwered them, the more they increaſed their repentaunce. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: If our hart accuſe vs, God is greater then our hart.<note place="margin">What we muſt aunſwer to the accuſation of our hart.</note> Our hart doth then accuſe vs, when we ſay vnto our ſelues: God wil not heare, bicauſe of our ſynnes, God doth the more accuſe vs, bicauſe he ſeeth more in vs, then wee our ſelues can ſee. Wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid: Clenſe me Lord from my ſecrete ſynnes. What remedy is there then? For who is he, whom his hart accuſeth not? Let vs turne our ſelues vnto Chriſt: and if that our hart ſhall ſay, he will not helpe, let vs ſay vnto it: This I may wel beleue, if I ſhould looke vpon my ſelfe onely, but I looke vpon the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, who hath geuen himſelf for me. Hereof ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that confidence which <hi>Paul</hi> had, when he ſaid: Who ſhall lay accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the elect of god? It is god which iuſtifieth. &amp;c. Wherefore if god accuſeth vs not, neither will our hart accuſe vs, when we beholde Chriſte. For we haue now confidence towardes god, and we ſhall obtaine. And whileſt wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto Chriſt, not onely accuſation and ſinne is aboliſhed, but repentance alſo is augmented, as we now ſee is done in the Hebrues.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18396:183" rendition="simple:additions"/> thruſt him out as a baſtard. The name of his father was <hi>Gilead,</hi> who ſeemeth to haue bene ſo called by the name of the mounte and citye.

Wherfore though <hi>Iiphtah</hi> had a noble man to his father, yet that nothing profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, bycauſe he was a baſtard, and not borne in lawful matrimony. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the ciuil law of the Hebrewes, it was not lawful for him to haue place in the congregation of Iſraell. For in <hi>Deut.</hi> it is written:<note place="margin">Baſtardes had not place in the congregation of Iſraell.</note> 
                     <hi>Mamzer</hi> ſhall not enter into the congregation or aſſembly. <hi>Zor</hi> is in Hebrew a ſtranger. And a baſtard is ſo called, bicauſe he pertaineth not vnto the famely of the father.</p>
                  <p>She that bare <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was not a wife, but a harlot. This Hebrewe word <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> ſignifieth two thinges.

Iuliam, de adult.</hi> And vndoubtedly eyther ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification may aptly be applyed vnto this place. Some of the Hebrewes thinke that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was not the ſonne of an harlot, but only the ſonne of a concubine, whych was not eſpouſed with wedding tables or bonds, and a dowry.<note place="margin">The mother of Iiphtah was not a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine.</note> But that ſemeth not very wel to agree.

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, if he had bene the ſonne of a Concubine. For the hauinge of Concubines of that ſorte, was with the Iewes true Matrimonye. Farther, wee muſte knowe that the Hebrewes had an other word, which ſignified an harlot. And that is <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daſhah,</hi> as though a man would ſay, <hi>ſancta,</hi> that is holy, as <hi>Virgill</hi> ſayth: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hunger of gold.</p>
                  <p>This word <hi>Kadaſh</hi> ſignifieth to prepare. For as godly men prepare and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify themſelues to the worſhipping of god: ſo do harlots prepare themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the decking and gayne of the body.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>Deut.</hi> the .23. it was commaunded, that no ſuch whore ſhould be in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell.

In the .21. of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> it was not law full for a prieſte to haue ſuch a one to wife.

What not to enter into the congregation ſignifieth.</note> I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, that god in dede commaunded there ſhoulde be none, but the people o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not.

Although otherwiſe he had to his father, eyther a prieſt or a ruler. Wherfore it was not lawful for baſtards to execute the office either of a Tribune, or of a Pretor, or Magiſtrate, or prieſte.</p>
                  <p>Why therfore doth god now make a baſtarde ruler ouer his people? Bycauſe he preſcribed the law vnto men, and not to himſelfe.

Farther, baſtards are not in the fathers power, neither can they be: but they that are naturall, may be, if they be made legitimate.

                  <p>After theſe Cannons whiche are ſomewhat fauorable vnto baſtardes,<note place="margin">What the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindereth baſtardes,</note> is brought out a ſtronge argument on the contrarye parte. Whoremongers (ſaye
<pb facs="tcp:18396:185"/> they) do ſeme to poure in a certayne power into the ſeede, whiche power paſſeth alſo into the children, wherof follow euill inclinations, and therof are they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be worſe then other, bycauſe when they ar children, they are not corrected. Wherfore if they be promoted vnto the holy miniſtery, the churche ſhall receaue dammage. Yet at the laſt it is added, in the chap. <hi>Cenomanenſis,</hi> if there be any that are notable, they maye be admitted vnto holye orders: but yet not that it ſhoulde be a generall rule of all, but onelye a priueledge. And theſe thinges are written in the decrees.</p>
                  <p>But in the decretalles <hi>de filiis preſbiterorum</hi> it is had, that baſtardes if they be made Monkes, may come vnto orders, but in ſuche ſorte that they be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted vnto dignities, and be not made eyther Abbottes or Priors. But if they liue without the monaſtery, the biſhop may ordeyne them, and geue them ſmall benefites, but that is by his authority, and (as they commonly cal it) by diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. But eccleſiaſticall dignities muſt not be geuen them, but by the Pope: for that power he kepeth to himſelfe alone.<note place="margin">The iudgment for promotinge of baſtardes muſt be left vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the church.</note> But ſuche releaſinges of Popes and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops tend onely to gayne. The iudgemente of theſe thinges ſhoulde haue beene left vnto the churche: which ought herein to haue a reſpect to two thinges, to her owne neceſſitye, and to the excellent vertues of him whome it will promote. If the Church ſhall haue greate neede, and he excell in vertues, the manner of his byrth ſhall nothing let him.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Paule</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and to <hi>Titus,</hi> when he diligently writeth of the election of biſhops and prieſtes, forbiddeth nothing of thys kynd of men. But thou wilt ſay, in the olde lawe baſtardes were excluded from the miniſterye. I graunte that, but we ar not now bound to that law, &amp; it was made onely for the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of aduoutry. But nowe if they can much profite the churche, theyr election is not to be prohibited. And it is vayn which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the decretals, that legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates maye be choſen,<note place="margin">A trifling diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the decre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tals.</note> but baſtards oughte to be reiected, except with diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is had in the title <hi>de electionibus.</hi> For theſe couloures and deceates the Romayne Byſhoppes haue inuented to amplyfye theyr dominion. But the ſentence whiche I haue allowed, agreeth with charitye: and we may gather the like of it out of the ciuil law, wher it is entreated of <hi>Decuriones,</hi> for theſe wer ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Iudges for priuate cities and townes.<note place="margin">Baſtardes might be made Decuriones.</note> Wherfore it is decreed that baſtardes might be made <hi>Decuriones,</hi> if neceſſity ſo required.

It is added in the lawe: If they be honeſt and good, the faulte of the byrth nothinge hindereth them. In the ſame tytle in lawe <hi>Spurios,</hi> and in the lawe followinge.

And it ſemeth meruelous, by what meanes that may be numbred among the titles of mercy. This thing the Heretikes, as the <hi>Martionites, Valentinians,</hi> and <hi>Carpocratians,</hi>

The Iewes alſo tooke that in euill parte, who in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the .18. chap. ſayd: Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue eaten ſowre grapes, &amp; the childrens teeth are ſet on edge. That was as much as if they ſhould haue ſayd: <hi>Ieroboam</hi> erected calues, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſetforth idolatry, &amp; muſt we be puniſhed for them?

                  <p>Some thinke that here muſt be vſed a diſtinction of euils and puniſhmentes.<note place="margin">A diſtinction of puniſhmentes.</note> For there are ſome puniſhementes ſay they, whiche pertayne vnto eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and there are other, whiche dure but for a tyme.

And in that ſort they expounde that which is ſayd in the law: I will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the ſinnes of the fathers vpon the children, vnto the thirde and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſemeth ſometymes to haue allowed this diſtinction.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> For in his queſtions vpon <hi>Ioſua</hi> the 8. queſtion, when he reaſoneth concernyng <hi>Achan,</hi> whiche had hidden ſome of the thinges that were curſed, for whoſe ſinne all the Iſraelites were miſerably afflicted, and for the ſame cauſe not onely <hi>Achan</hi> was puniſhed, but alſo his ſonnes and daughters were put to death together with him: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (I ſay) ſayth there, that thoſe puniſhmentes may both profit, and alſo hinder, which thing God hymſelfe knoweth, and therfore he tempreth them accordyng to his iuſtice. For god ſo moderateth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they do both afflicte the wicked, and are not hurtfull to the good. For ſuch is his prouidence, that thoſe thinges whiche ſeme euill, he can make good: but as touching eternall puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, bycauſe they alwayes are hurtfull, euery man worthily ſuffreth them according to his euil deſert.

And agaynſt <hi>Iulianus</hi> the <hi>Pelagian</hi> is his .6. booke the 12. chap. he maketh a diuiſion of the eſtate of people, and ſayth that ſome are regenerate in Chriſt, but other ſome are not yet regenerate.

But before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, originall ſinne infecteth and deſtroyeth all poſterityes.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> I diſalow not, but I doubt whether it be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently applyed vnto the meaning of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Ieremy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezechiel and Ieremy wrote both the ſelfe ſame wordes in ſundry places.</note> Both thoſe Prophetes wrote theſe ſelfe ſame wordes.

                  <p>But when I more attentyuely doo weighe the chap. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> I thinke that he ſpeaketh of the puniſhmentes and afflictions of this lyfe.

They complayne that God ſemeth to deale to hardly with them: bycauſe for as much as their fathers were idolaters, yet they which had not ſinned, were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For thoſe puniſhementes the people lamented: wherfore it was neceſſary, that the Prophet ſhould aunſwere them of the ſame puniſhementes. The ſoule of the father is myne, and the ſoule of the ſonne is myne. The ſoule whiche hath ſinned, it ſhal dye. Theſe wordes therfore haue a reſpect vnto the puniſhmentes of this lyfe. Although I do not deny, but that it may alſo be tranſferred vnto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes:<note place="margin">Argumentum a minori ad maius.</note> but not, vnles it be by an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the les to the great. And that after this maner, God doth not for an other mans ſinne puniſhe, with paynes which dure, but for a tyme, thoſe whiche are vtterly innocent, therfore much les will he puniſhe them with ſpirituall and eternall puniſhmentes.</p>

                  <p>Nowe lette vs expounde the woordes of the lawe. I (ſayeth he) am a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, viſityng the iniquity of the Fathers vpon the chyldren, vnto the third and fourth generation, of them that hate me.<note place="margin">Ierome. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                     </note> Theſe laſt woords <hi>Ierome</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the .18. chapter diligently noteth. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon <hi>Ioſua</hi> in the queſtion before alledged. Of thoſe, ſayeth GOD, which hate me: as though he ſhould haue ſayd, I wyll not touch the innocents, but will take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce of their iniquity, which imitate euill Fathers, and hath me. After the ſame manner he promiſeth to doo good vnto children, and chyldrens chyldren, euen vnto a thouſande generations. But to what chyldren? Euen to thoſe, (ſayeth he) that loue me. Wherefore thoughe the Father bee vngodly, and the ſonne good, the iniquitye of the father ſhall nothyng hurte hym. But if the father bee good, and the ſonne wicked, the godlynes of the father ſhall nothyng profyte hym. And therefore <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayeth: He auengeth the iniquitye of the Fathers vpon the children, not bycauſe they had euyll parentes, but bycauſe they imitate theyr parentes. The woordes themſelues doo ſufficiently declare, that the lawe is not to bee vnderſtande of Originall ſynne, but of that ſynne whiche they call actuall. For then ſhall the ſonne beare the iniquitye of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he lykewyſe ſynneth as dyd the Father. Alſo the wordes of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> can not bee vnderſtande of Originall ſynne, as that whiche followeth eaſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth. Although thys ſentence, that the ſoule whiche ſinneth, it ſhal dye, maye bee vnderſtande of Originall ſynne.<note place="margin">Euery manne hath in himſelf his proper ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne.</note> For euery manne hath in hymſelfe a corrupte nature, and a prones vnto euill. Wherefore euery manne beareth hys owne ſynne. For althoughe that vice were by originall drawen of the parentes: yet nowe is it made ours.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilte ſaye: ſeyng in the lawe it is ſayde, Of them whiche hate me: and infantes, for as much as they hate not God, therefore it can not pertayne vnto them. I aunſwer. That in act in dede they hate not God, but by corruption of nature, and prones vnto euill. So a woolfe that is at full age deuoureth a ſheepe. A younge woolfe whiche is but a whelpe doth it not, not bycauſe it hath not the nature of the father, but bycauſe it is not able. And thus muche as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the wordes of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>But why it is ſayde vnto the thirde and fourth generation, and not vnto the fyft and ſixt, we haue hearde what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath aunſwered. But in my iudgement we maye ſaye muche more commodiouſly, that the parentes may lyue vnto the thirde and fourth generation. GOD woulde therefore ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe the Fathers in the thirde and fourth generation, that by that punyſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theyr poſterity, ſome feelyng myght come vnto them, they beyng yet on lyue, &amp; that they myght ſee the miſeryes of theyr neuewes &amp; childrens chyldren. For thys cauſe the holy Scripture extendeth thoſe generations no farther. When the poſteritye are euill, and are puniſhed of GOD, there is no doubte but that the parentes are punyſhed alſo in them. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Geneſis</hi> the.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:188"/> 29. Homely when he interpreteth theſe woordes: Curſed be <hi>Chanaan,</hi> &amp;c. But he ſynned not (ſayeth he,) but hys father <hi>Cham.</hi> That is true in deede, he aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth: but <hi>Cham</hi> was a greate deale more ſharpely touched with that curſe, then if it had bene pronounced agaynſte hymſelfe. Thys is the powre and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection, to bee more vexed with the afflictions of theyr chyldren, then with theyr owne. Wherefore <hi>Cham</hi> dyd not onely ſee that hys ſonne ſhould be euill and ſubiecte vnto the curſe: but alſo he ſawe that he hymſelfe ſhoulde bee puniſhed in hym.</p>
                  <p>This nowe reſteth to bee declared, why amonge the Proprietyes of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of GOD, this alſo was recited before <hi>Moſes:</hi> Viſityng the iniquitye of the Fathers vpon the children, when as this ſeemeth rather to pertayne vnto ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But it is not ſo, yea rather if we looke more narrowly vpon the place, we ſhall vnderſtande that it is a pointe of mercy. For where the ſinne was firſte committed, he myght ſtrayghtwaye if he woulde, iuſtly bee reuenged. But he is ſo good that he wyll defer the vengeaunce vnto the thirde and fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and in the meane tyme calleth backe the father to repentaunce, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the Prophetes, by ſermons and benefites, and many other wayes. At the laſte, when the thirde and fourth generation is come, and he made neuer a whitte the better, he goeth to ſtripes, and yet he doth not then vſe affliction, as the laſte puniſhement, but rather as a medecine. Who ſeeth not that all this is a woorke of greate mercye? Wherefore iuſtly and woorthily are theſe wordes numbred amonge the proprietyes of mercye. And it can not bee denyed, but that the Prophetes were oftentymes afflicted together with the people. For <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were led awaye into captiuity, and <hi>Ieremy</hi> was caſte into priſon, and wonderfully vexed in the tyme of the ſiege: and afterwarde goyng with the Hebrues into <hi>Egypte,</hi> he was ſlayne. For God will haue the thyng in thys manner ordered, that good men, may not onely ryghtly gouerne their own lyfe, but alſo in ſuffryng thynges greuous, they may admoniſhe and bryng to amendement the euill. For they are conuerſant together with them in the ſame publique wealth and Churche, and are after a ſorte members of one body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It profiteth the iuſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are wrapped in the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes with the wicked.</note>Wherfore the good ought thus to thinke with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: If God afflicte the euill, we alſo ſhalbe vexed together with them: we ſhall all be wrapped with the ſelfe ſame puniſhement. Therefore we muſt ſee, that we labour for them, in reprouyng and prayng for them: for theyr ſaluation beyng neglected, ſhall bryng euilles alſo vnto vs. After thys ſorte we muſte vnderſtande <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he ſayeth, that GOD by thys meanes eſtablyſheth diſcipline amonge men. Bycauſe if the people bee afflicted for their kynges, and the ſonne for the father: then muſt they labour and trauayle one for an other. Neither yet do good men ſo lyue without ſinne, that God can finde nothyng in them to puniſhe.

There is in deede in holy menne a certayne ryghteouſnes, but not ſuch a righteouſnes as they can boaſt of, before the iudgement ſeate of God. Wherfore if they ſuffer any thing, they haue no iuſt cauſe to complayne.</p>
                  <p>But thou, wilt ſaye: Why is it ſayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puniſheth the ſinnes of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when as they alſo ſinne? We ſhould ſay rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he puniſheth their ſinnes,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18396:188"/> and not the ſynnes of their parentes. I anſwere: Bycauſe when god hath much and longe tyme wayted, that their father ſhould repent, and it nothing profited, and in the meane tyme it is come vnto the third and fourth generation, at the length he poureth out his anger vpon the children, whiche therefore are ſayd to ſuffer for their fathers, bicauſe vnles the malice of their fathers had gone before, their affliction might haue ben deferred till farther time. But now bycauſe they haue fallen into the third and fourth generation, the conſideration of the iuſtice of god wil not ſuffer the puniſhement to be deferred any longer. And althoughe they themſelues alſo haue deſerued thoſe euils, yet bycauſe they are ſo corrected in the third and fourth generation, they owe that dewty vnto their parentes.</p>
                  <p>And ſo God feareth the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that they ſhould temper themſelues from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actes: and thoughe they will not for gods ſake, or for their own, yet at the leaſt for theyr poſterities ſake. It alſo maketh the children afrayde to imitate the ſinnes of their fathers, leaſt the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t due vnto their fathers be required of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither is it vniuſt that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children ſuffer ſomthing for their fathers ſake: for by their fathers they receaue inheritances, and are aboue other honored and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. For god did not onely make fortunate <hi>Dauid,</hi> but alſo for his ſake fauored his poſterity. For the kyngdome perſeuered in his famely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of .400. yeares.

For in <hi>Deut.</hi> the .24. chap. it is commaunded: That the fathers ſhould not be puniſhed for the children, nor the children for the parentes. Whiche is to be vnderſtande, ſo that the father conſent not vnto the ſonne, or the ſonne vnto the father. Wherefore <hi>Achan</hi> if he had bene called vnto tryall and to the iudgement ſeate, he ſhould be the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary lawe haue peryſhed alone, and not hys chyldren with hym. But GOD hath thys hys proper law, who would haue it otherwyſe done, although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes he obſerueth thys alſo. For in the booke of <hi>Numbers:</hi> the 26. chap. When <hi>Core</hi> conſpired agaynſte <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was deſtroyed: but hys chyldren were not together with hym extinguiſhed,<note place="margin">Samuel came of the poſterity of Core.</note> yea rather they were kepte for the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterye, and of their poſteritye was <hi>Samuel</hi> borne. <hi>Amaſias</hi> the kynge was prayſed, who ſlewe the murtherers whiche killed his father, and ſlewe not their
<pb facs="tcp:18396:189"/> children: for he had a regard vnto the law of God. The cauſe of this prohibition <hi>Auguſtine</hi> bringeth:<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> God (ſayth he) may puniſhe the ſonne for the father: bycauſe although he afflicte hym in this worlde, yet he can ſaue hym in the worlde to come. And this can not man doo. Farther, god ſeeth that the children are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes: but man ſeeth not that. Although the ciuill lawes are herein a great deale more ſeuere, and do puniſhe the children for the fathers ſake, as it is in the digeſtes,<note place="margin">In treaſon the children are pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed for the fathers.</note> and in the <hi>Code, ad I. Iuliam maieſtatis:</hi> yet they put not the ſonne to death for the father, but depriue hym of all hys fathers goods, dignityes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Howbeit they lefte ſome parte for the doughters, whiche parte was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Falcidia,</hi> to mary them withall. Otherwiſe the ciuile lawes agree with the lawe of god. For in the <hi>Code de paenis</hi> in the lawe <hi>Sancimus,</hi> it is commaunded that the puniſhement be not tranſferred vnto other, either to kinſfolkes by affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or to kinſfolkes by bloud, but onely to be layd vpon the author of the crime. And yet as wel this law as the other before, were ordeyned both of the ſelf ſame Emperours <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius.</hi> But the cauſe why it was ſo ſeuerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed agaynſt treaſon, ſeemeth to be this, to feare men away from this kynde of wicked crime. Yet the lawes of god decree no ſuche thing of that matter: but this by expreſſe woordes they commaunde, not to kyll the ſonne for the father. But for goods they ordayne nothyng. But our aduerſaryes haue tranſferred thys ciuill lawe of treaſon vnto Heretikes. For they doo not onely puniſhe the father whiche is an Heretike, but alſo they depryue hys children of all his goods: howe iuſtly, I will not nowe tell. Of theſe thinges I haue made mention the more largely: bycauſe <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was thruſt out of hys fathers inheritaunce, and thereby ſeemed to beare the iniquity of hys father. Nowe wyll I returne vnto the Hyſtory.</p>

Therfore he got him to an other place, and exerciſed the arte of warrefare.

                  <p>But the requeſte of <hi>Iiphtah</hi> is not ambicious. For that vice then hath place, when the office of a magiſtrate is ſought by bribery,<note place="margin">Iiphtah is not guilty or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</note> deceite, corruption and euil artes. But when a man ſeeth himſelfe to be called vnto it, and that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the pub. wealth, and vnderſtandeth that he can obtayne the office of a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate vpon an honeſt condicion, it can not be ſayde that he doth it ambiciouſlye. <hi>Iiphtah</hi> is now choſen, to endaunger himſelfe for his country, to fight agaynſte the enemies of god,<note place="margin">A compariſon betwene Abi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>melech and Iiphtah.</note> he vſeth no bribery nor deceat: Wherfore he is far from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But <hi>Abimelech</hi> did far otherwiſe behaue himſelfe, he ſlew his bretherne, did violence vnto the Sechemites, and tooke away the holy mony.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Iiphtah</hi> although he were reprochfully handled of his owne friendes, yet he ſlayeth them not, neyther didde he ſollicyte the <hi>Gileadites</hi> to create him ruler, onely he promiſeth that he will go to the battayle, ſo that they woulde performe that which of theyr own accord they offred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A queſtion, whether theſe mens doyinges were lawfull.</note>But here may iuſtly be demaunded, how it was lawfull for them to geue the principality vnto <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> or for him to take it vpon him, being <hi>Mamzer.</hi> For the law commaunded that no <hi>Mamzer ſhould not enter into the congregation of god which was, eyther to take vpon him any ſacred miniſtery,</hi> or els the office of a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrate. Vndoubtedly none of the Hebrewe, Greke and lattin interpreters, that I know of, once marked this doubte. But I thinke herein may two reaſons be alledged. Firſte, although the lawe ſeemeth to be violated, yet god, who was the author of the law, would at thime time by this priueledge haue infringed. And we may vnderſtand that they wer admoniſhed by an oracle, to chuſe him prince, which ſhould fyrſt ſet vpon the enemies, whatſoeuer he were. This if they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the inſpiration of god, then were they free from the lawe: for they myghte thinke with themſelues, that God made the lawe for men, and not for hymſelfe. This is a ſingular priueledge of god, wherein he commaunded that whoſoeuer fought firſt, ſhould be made the head. <hi>Iiphtah</hi> fought: Wherfore by the couenant and iudgemente of God, it was neceſſarye that he ſhoulde be choſen the heade.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18396:190"/> But what if without any oracle they had determined this thing onely by iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment among themſelues? Sinned they or no in making a baſtard their captain? No verely. For this is to be obſerued in all preceptes,<note place="margin">What is to be done when two preceptes for one time are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary one to an other.</note> aſwell ceremoniall as iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and morall, when two preceptes of god do ſeme to be contrary one to an other, ſo that the one is a let vnto the other, that they cannot both be obſerued at one time, yea rather it is neceſſarye that the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be for that time omitted, then that which ſhalbe iudged to be more weyghtye and better is to be retayned. And yet in the meane time is not that other which is counted of les value viola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted: becauſe there in is nothing done againſt the will of god. The law commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth euery man to defende the helth of his neyghbour, &amp; if a man be magiſtrate,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> to defend his city by municions. The ſame law commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not to labor on the Sabaoth day. The enemye beiſegeth the city and that on the Sabaoth daye, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth that that law is layd vpon the citizens. Here ſeemeth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of preceptes: for on the one parte health is to be defended, and on the other part the Sabaoth is to be obſerued. The Machabites iudged it beſt to fighte, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the health of the publike wealth ſeemed greater and of antiquitye,<note place="margin">An other ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> then the ceremony of the Sabaoth. Alſo the law is to feede the hungry, and an other law commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that the ſhew bread ſhould be eaten of none, but of the prieſts onely. <hi>Dauid</hi> being hungry cometh vnto the prieſt, he hath nothing but the ſhew bread: wherfore two contrary preceptes come together. But the wiſe prieſt follo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth and obſerueth that which is the greater, namely to feede the hungrye, and bringeth forth the ſhew bread, and helpeth <hi>Dauid.</hi> Alſo ther is an other law,<note place="margin">The iii. ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> that we muſte miniſter weapons vnto the Magiſtrate, For he muſte be holpen of his ſubiectes. And it is contrarily ordeyned that thinges conſecrated vnto god ſhall not be tranſferred to other vſes. <hi>Dauid</hi> the kings ſonne in law, and his captayne which made warres for him, as the chiefe of his warrefare, was then vnarmed, the prieſt had no wepon at hand, but onely the ſword of <hi>Goliath.</hi> Here ar two pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cepts which ſeme contrary, the prieſt followeth the one, &amp; geueth vnto the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſword, bycauſe he iudged it better to arme the magiſtrate, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ceremony. There is alſo a law that the church ſhoulde not be without miniſters, ſo that it ſhoulde be deſtitute of them.<note place="margin">The fourth ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</note> And there is an other lawe in <hi>Paule</hi> that <hi>Neophytus,</hi> that is, a man newelye entred into Chriſtian relygion, ſhould not be made a byſhop. The church of Myllan was without a byſhop, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it finde a mete biſhop, which was both pure from the ſect of the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and there withall had alſo greate authoritye and doctrine of god.

And yet he doth not ſay that he will not haue ſacrifice, but if two preceptes meete together, whereof the one is of mercy, and the other of ſacrifice, he teſtifieth that he had rather haue mercy then ſacrifice. So it ſeemeth was now don as touching <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two lawes vrged, the one to defend the city from ſtraungers: and the other that a baſtard ſhould not be made a Magiſtrate, that law was to be obſerued, which ſerued beſt for the ſafety of the city.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Iiphtah</hi> by his meſſengers ſaith vnto the king of <hi>Ammon: what haſt thou to do with me?</hi> he vſeth a phraſe very much vſed of the Hebrues. He inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the cauſe, as though he woulde haue ſayde: why inuadeſt thou our landes? what diſcord or iniuries are there betwene thee and me? The king of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi> anſwered, that he therefore made warre, bicauſe the Iſraelites did hym iniury, which tooke away his landes, namely from the borders of <hi>Arnon,</hi> euen to <hi>Iaboc</hi> and <hi>Iarden.</hi> He complayneth that all that coaſt was taken from hym, which was betwene thoſe riuers. This he pretendeth to be the cauſe of the war. And he deſired that they would reſtore peaceablye, that is, without warre, that which they had taken away from him. He ſeemeth to promiſe that he will leaue of from warre, if the Iſraelites woulde performe this. <hi>Iiphtah</hi> denieth that the thyng is ſo: <hi>VVe haue not taken away</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>your land.</hi> And bringeth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>Bicauſe when the Iſraelites came vp out of Egipt, they of their owne wyll ſent meſſengers vnto the kyng of Edom, that they might haue leaue to paſſe throughe his borders: which thing he would not let them doo:</hi> ſo farre is it of that wee dyd them iniury. <hi>The people abode in Cades:</hi> ſo muche tempered they themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> violence and weapons. <hi>They went on the ſyde of the land of Edom:</hi> for the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> would not permit Iſrael, to go ſtraight through the middeſt of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Wherefore my people rather iourneyed with great labour, then that they were troubleſome vnto any man. <hi>And pitched beyond Arnon.</hi> There were the endes of <hi>Moab</hi> Wherefore ye can not complaine that we did anye man iniurye. Therfore when the Iſraelites ſaw that they could not leade their hoſt throughe the borders of <hi>Edom</hi> or <hi>Moab, they ſent vnto Sihon king of the Amorhites: But he would not:</hi> neither did he onely denye them paſſage through his borders, but alſo aſſembled an hoſt, and purſued them. And the battaile beyng ioyned, God deliuered him in to the handes of the Iſraelites.<note place="margin">The Iſraelites poſſeſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land by the righte of warre.</note> Wherefore (ſayth he) we haue done thee no wrong: for this land we poſſeſſe by the right of warre. <hi>Sihon</hi> aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs with his power, and the victory fel on our ſyde: wherfore both he, and all his land by the right of warre came into our power.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Balac</hi> of whom he ſpeaketh, was he which hired <hi>Bileam</hi> to curſſe the Iewes.

                     <hi>Heſbon</hi> was the kingly Citye of <hi>Sihon.

                     </note>This Oration, as farre as it appeareth, pertaineth vnto the iudicial kynde, and entreateth of poſſeſſion, and the reaſons are layde foorth. But nowe let vs marke that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> before he moueth battail, ſendeth meſſengers before. That is a cuſtome verye laudable: For <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> writeth in his firſt booke, that it was the maner of <hi>Rome,</hi> that before warre was proclaymed againſte their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, meſſengers were ſent to complaine of the iniuries, and to require againe the thinges taken away. And if by their meſſage they nothing profited, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto the Senate: who vnderſtanding the matter, proclaimed war by the publike aſſent. For wiſe men iudged it not beſt, raſhlye and ſodainlye to fall to warres. So <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> though he were a warlike and valiant man, yet woulde he gouerne the matter wiſely and moderatlye: For he was not ſo light brained as many now adayes are, who firſte prepare them ſelues to battaile, and make a bragging, before any man know that there is any warre proclaimed. God thus ordained in the <hi>.27.</hi> chap. of <hi>Deut.</hi> when thou ſhalt come to any Citye, thou ſhalt firſte offer peace. So <hi>Iiphtah</hi> aſſayeth firſte to compoſe the matter by woords, before he goeth to hand ſtrokes. The king of <hi>Ammon</hi> alledgeth a cauſe in dede, but it is but a fained cauſe: for firſt it was not the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Ammon,</hi> but of <hi>Moab,</hi> and the <hi>Amorhites</hi> draue them out, as the ſecond chap. of <hi>Deut.</hi> teſtifieth. For Iſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rael had none of their landes.

                  <p>So is it alſo by the lawes of God. <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it manifeſtlye appeareth in the booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the .14. chap. made warre againſt the .v. kinges, whiche had led away <hi>Lot</hi> priſoner.

Wherfore we muſt beleue that that pray was truelye in his poſſeſſion. For in that he gaue it to the king of <hi>Sodom,</hi> it was of his mere liberality: for he was not therunto compelled by the law.

Such a war is counted iuſt, whiche is taken in hande at the commaundement of the Magiſtrate, either to demaund things againe, or els to put away iniuries, or to reuenge them, as it is had in the .23. queſtion, the .2. chap. <hi>iuſtum,</hi> and they ar the woordes of <hi>Iſidorus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſidorus</note> For firſt we muſt beware that war be not taken in hande by the authority of a priuate man. But the cauſes wherfore war may iuſtlye be made, are theſe, to require thinges taken away, or els to repulſe iniury. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is agreable that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth in the ſame place in the chapter <hi>Dominus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Iuſt war is that which is taken in hand to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge iniuries. After this maner war is iuſtly proclaimed againſt Cities, when they wyll not either ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thinges taken away, or amende thoſe thinges which of theirs was vniuſtly done. For if they wil not puniſh the guilty, it is lawful for other to make warre againſt them. So al Iſrael tooke war in hand againſt <hi>Beniamin,</hi> that a moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wicked crime ſhould not remaine vnpuniſhed. But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> addeth, that thoſe warres alſo do in eſpecial ſeme iuſt, which are taken in hande by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, as are many which were done in the old Teſtament. For if God commaunde once to make warre, wee muſte not ſeeke for anye other cauſe of iuſtice. For God knoweth very well what is to be rendred vnto euery man. For then both captaine and ſouldiours are not ſo muche to be counted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the warre, as miniſters of God &amp; of his law. And therfore when the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple are after this maner called to war, they ought not to neglect the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Auguſtine</note> Wherfore the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his .205. epiſtle to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the Earle, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of war, which at that time gouerned <hi>Affrike</hi> vnder <hi>Ceſar:</hi> Thou oughteſt not (ſaith he) to thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which with weapons ſerue the publik wealth, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not pleaſe God. This was the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherof afterward he bringeth reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith he, made many wars, and yet was he dearely beloued of God.</p>
                  <p>And vndoubtedly I could bring forth very many examples out of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. But the Anabaptiſtes cry, that the old Teſtament pertaineth nothing vnto vs. I wil therfore make mencion of thoſe thinges whych <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of the new Teſtament. The Centurion came vnto Chriſt, and deſired him to heale his ſeruant which was ſicke: but Chriſt ſaid he would come to hys houſe. The Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turion ſaid: I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come vnder my roofe: but onely ſay the woord, &amp; my ſeruant ſhalbe healed. And other woordes which are red in the .8. chapter of <hi>Mathew.</hi> At the laſt Chriſt anſwered, that he founde not ſo muche faith in Iſrael, no not in thoſe whiche ſeemed moſt holye.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18396:193"/> And the ſame man was a Centurion, and had ſoldiours vnder him: vnto whom for all that Chriſt aſcribeth a very good and moſt excellent faythe. In the Actes alſo of the Apoſtles, the .x. chapter, it is written that <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſo lyued in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that the Angell teſtified of hym, that hys prayers wer heard of God. Yea &amp; God alſo ſo regarded hym, that at <hi>Peters</hi> hande he hearde the Goſpell, was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and receaued the holye ghoſt. And the Soldiours when they came vnto Iohn, to be baptiſed of him, as it is in the third chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> aſked what they ſhould doo. Iohn aunſwered, ye ſhall doo violence vnto no man: bee ye content with your wages. Neyther called he them backe from warfare, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them, when he commaunded them to be content wyth their wages. The ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſte <hi>Fauſtus</hi> in his .xxii. booke, and .lxxiiii. chapter ſaythe: The Lorde was tempted of the <hi>Herodians,</hi> whither it were lawfull to geue tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and he aunſwered: Geue vnto <hi>Ceſar</hi> that whych is <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and the thinges that are of God, to God. By which woordes he woulde ſignifye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but that tributes are to be geuen vnto Princes. And tributes are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that Princes ſhould vſe the ſwoorde, defend the right of the publike welth, and make warre, when neede ſhall require. Which thing if it had not bene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the Lord would neuer haue commaunded them to pay tributes vnto them.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to the Epiſtle of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> In making of iuſt war, ſaith he,<note place="margin">What thynges are to be taken heede of in iuſte warres.</note> many thinges are to be taken heede of. For it is not ſufficient that the warre be iuſt, except alſo the warre be iuſtly handled. Wherefore he admoniſheth hys Earle: when, ſaythe hee, thou putteſt on thyne armour, remember that thy ſtrength is the gyft of God, and determine wyth thy ſelfe not to abuſe that gift againſt God. Yea rather doo thys, fyght for hys lawes and name, let promiſes be kept euen with enemies, but muche more with friendes, for whom thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt warre. By which woordes hee reprehendeth thoſe Soldiours, whiche are more grieuous in Cities, then the very enemies, of which we ſee in our dayes a great many mo then we would, which when they are in their places where they wynter, it is wonderfull to ſee how they handle the Citezens, and the men of the country: it is horrible to ſee what filthy and abhominable things they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. He addeth alſo the thirde caution. Thinke with thy ſelfe that warre muſt not be made but for neceſſity. Wherefore let the minde alwaies be enclined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to peace. Make warre, bicauſe thou canſt not otherwyſe doo: but if thou canſt make peace, refuſe it not.</p>
                  <p>Warre is taken in hand onely to amende thinges amyſſe. Yea, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles afflicted certaine, that they might become the better. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd vnto the <hi>Corrinthians,</hi> deliuer ſuche a one to Sathan to the deſtruction of the fleſhe, that the ſpirite may be ſaued. And to <hi>Timothe</hi> he ſayth of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexander,</hi> I haue delyuered them to Sathan, to learne not to curſſe. So oughte they alſo to reſtrayne Princes, that they maye bee made better. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo in his .xix.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> booke <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> ſayth, that warres though they bee neuer ſo iuſt, yet vnto godly men, they ſeeme both troubleſome and grieuous: for beſydes other things which the nature of man eſcheweth, they ſhall ſee the iniquity of their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſyde, for which they are compelled to fyght: and they cannot but be ſorye for it. And in the Epiſtle before alledged: Rage not, ſaythe hee, nor waxe not inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agaynſt thoſe that ſubmyt them ſelues, but ſhewe mercye to thoſe that are ouercome. Wherefore <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayth: Spare them that ſubmit them ſelues,<note place="margin">Virgil.</note> and deſtroye the proude.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer he admoniſheth the ſame Earle, to beware of vyces, whyche are wont to followe hoſtes, namelye of fylthye luſte, of rauenous pyllynge, and of dronkenneſſe. For it is a thyng moſte vyle for thee therefore to make warre, to amende the vices of others, when as thou in the meane tyme art a great deale more vicious, and muche more art ouercome bothe wyth affections
<pb facs="tcp:18396:194"/> and diſeaſes, then they are whyche are ouercome.</p>
                  <p>For in warre we reproue not the ende, but the deſire to hurt, the crueltye of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement, the outragiouſneſſe of rebelling, and the luſt of bearing dominion. Theſe thinges ſaith he, are condemned. For they, which forſaking ſuche vices doo make iuſt warre, are the Miniſters of God and of the lawes. The ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt <hi>Fauſtus Manicheus:</hi> This order ſaith he, is to bee kept, that the war be proclaimed, either of God, or of Princes, to breake the pryde of man, and to came the ſtubburne.</p>
                  <p>Farther, the Souldiours oughte to bee perſwaded, that the warre is iuſtlye made, and not taken in hande againſte the woorde of God: otherwyſe let them not fight. Neither doo I to this ende ſpeake theſe thinges, bicauſe I woulde haue Soldiours to vnderſtand the ſecretes of Princes, but that knowing &amp; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly they ſuffer not themſelues to fight againſt true and iuſt cauſes. Yet it may be (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) that the Prince may make warre againſte his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet his Soldiours nothing offende, ſo long as they obey the ordinarye power. For the people muſt obey their Prince. And in their ſo doyng, it may be doubtfull vnto them, whether their Prince make warre contrarye to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. But they are excuſed, ſo long as they obey their owne Prince in a doubtful cauſe, their own Prince I ſay, and not a ſtraunge Prince. Wherefore thoſe hired Soldiours can not be excuſed, which hauing no reſpecte vnto the cauſe,<note place="margin">Againſte hyred Soldiours.</note> but onely for mony and rewardes ſake do ſerue ſtraunge Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Wherefore <hi>Iiphtah</hi> thus reaſoned, as touching the firſt point of his Oraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we haue taken the land by the right of warre: therefore thou vniuſtly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the ſame of vs.</p>
                  <p>The next poynt is, our God hath geuen it vnto vs, whiche is the Lorde and diſtributer of all thinges humane. He brinketh his argument from the gyfte of God.<note place="margin">God is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buter of kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. <hi>Virgil.</hi>
                     </note> And that God might geue and diſtribute kingdomes, the verye Ethnike authours alſo ſawe. And therefore in <hi>Virgil Eneas</hi> doth ſo often boaſt, that hee by the commaundement of God went into Italy, and for that cauſe would not abide either at <hi>Carthage,</hi> or in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> when he mought haue obtained either of thoſe kingdomes.<note place="margin">Auguſtine</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his .v. booke <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> the .xxviii. chap. Of kingdomes ſayth he, and Prouinces it is certaine that God diſtributeth them, both when, and how muche, and to whom hee wyll: and that by ſecrete iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but not vniuſt. In the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> God promiſed vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity, the land of <hi>Chanaan:</hi> but hee promiſed it after foure hundred yeares. Now, ſaith he, I wyl not geue it, for as yet the ſynnes of the <hi>Chananites</hi> are not full. I wyll not caſt them out now, but I wyll tary tyll their iniquitye be come to the hygheſt: afterward I wyll bring you in. Alſo in the ſeconde chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> it is written that the <hi>Horites</hi> dwelled in mount <hi>Seir,</hi> which were men experte in warres and very valiant, whom God ſayth he draue oute of thoſe mountaynes, that the Chyldren of <hi>Eſau</hi> myght poſſeſſe the lande. And in the ſame chapter he teſtifieth that he dyd caſt out the people of <hi>Emim,</hi> &amp; gaue their kingdomes vnto the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and draue out <hi>Zanzumim</hi> oute of theyr places, and placed the <hi>Moabites</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>If thou wylt ſay, that thys was done by God peculiarly agaynſte theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, bycauſe the <hi>Edomites</hi> had their ofſpring of <hi>Eſau,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> which was kynſman vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and had together with hym accompliſhed moſt daungerous viages: I aunſwer, the ſame may be ſaide alſo in the ſame place of other nacions, which came not of <hi>Abrahrm.</hi> The <hi>Capado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> draue out the <hi>Heuites</hi> whyche were the firſt inhabiters, who going out of <hi>Capadocia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How regions are ſayde to bee deuided by lot.</note> deſtroyed them, and in their place inhabited thoſe Regions. And in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the .xxxii. chapter it is wrytten, when God by lot deuided the Gentiles, and the people according to the number of the Chyldren of Iſraell.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18396:194"/> In that it is ſayde to be done by lot, al that is to be referred vnto our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, whiche ſee not the cauſes of thinges. But wyth God nothing is done by lot. God hath diſtributed the nacions according to the number of the chyldren of Iſrael. For the Iſraelites were not yet increaſed, when God put the people in thoſe Regions, who at the laſte gaue place vnto the Iſraelites when they came.</p>
                  <p>Neyther ought we to be offended, if by this diſtribution oftentimes fertil and fat landes happen vnto the vngodly. For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in hys .4.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> booke <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> the .xxxiii. chapter, ſayth: That giftes whiche dure but for a tyme, happen both to the iuſt and vniuſt. For God maketh his ſunne to ſhyne, both vpon the good and the euyll, and rayneth vpon the iuſt and vniuſt. But by this common benefite the godly haue this commoditye onely, that they vnderſtande that theſe thinges are not the chiefeſt gyftes which wee oughte to looke for, bycauſe theſe are common both to the good and to the euyll. But the godlye wayte for other more excellent, which are not common to the good and euyll. Yea and <hi>Danyel</hi> ſaith: The name of the Lord be bleſſed for euer: for it is he whiche tranſferreth kingdomes, and driueth out the firſt inhabiters, and bringeth in other. Neither doth he onely bring men into Prouinces, but alſo ſetteth Aungels to rule ouer them, as we there reade of the Prince of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Grecians.</hi> And he hath not onely deuided men by landes, but alſo by tounges and manners. Farther, we muſt remember that theſe mutacions were not done onelye at the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but alſo in the latter times. For the Frenche men poſſeſſed <hi>Gallia,</hi> and the Engliſhe Saxones <hi>Britane.</hi> but the Britanes heing caſt out by them, found new places in <hi>Gallia</hi> by power and violence, and that part whiche they obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they called <hi>Britane</hi> of them ſelues. The men of <hi>Gallia</hi> alſo of late, going out of their own borders, poſſeſſed a great part of Italy. The <hi>Hunnes</hi> ſubdued vnto themſelues the <hi>Pannonites,</hi> and called the Countrey <hi>Hungaria.</hi> So God diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth kyngdomes, caſteth out ſome, and bringeth in other ſome, as it ſeemeth good vnto his iuſt iudgement, which is ſecrete. For the earth is the Lordes, and the fulnes thereof. This diſtribution chaunced euen from the beginning to the ſonnes of <hi>Noe,</hi> and afterwarde to thoſe whych builded the Tower of <hi>Babel:</hi> for God diſperſed them throughout the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Now I wyl declare by what meanes God is wont to geue kyngdomes.<note place="margin">God diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of his mere libe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rality.</note> He geueth them of his owne liberalitye, no right compelling him thereunto. That is the true manner of gifte, which otherwyſe is not a gift, vnleſſe it be free. And yet nothing letteth, but that God by the dutyes and obedience of godlye men, may be prouoked to geue. He geueth in deede often tymes manye thinges vnto godly men, but yet of no dutye. For there hath bene none at anye tyme ſo god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, that he coulde deſyre any thing of God, as his owne by right. For hee muſte doo hys dutye, though God geue nothing. And yet is a gyft a certayne reward, which although it be free, and geuen wythout any right compelling thereunto, neuertheleſſe, bicauſe it is after a ſorte beſtowed vpon duties, it hath a ſhewe of a rewarde. So in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> God gaue a gift vnto the king of <hi>Babilon.</hi> Bycauſe (ſayth he) he laboured in the ſiege of <hi>Tire,</hi> I wyll geue vnto hym the lande of <hi>Egipt.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">Giftes maye be reuoked.</note>But it may be demaunded, whether ſuche giftes maye bee reuoked?

                  </p>
                  <p>A great ingratitude alſo of hym that is endued wyth the gifte, debilitateth the gyft: for if he be ſo ingrate, that he wyll bee contumelious and reprochefull vnto the geuer, the gift is then reuoked.

For if we ſhall continue thankefull, and ſtande to the condicions, the gyft ſhoulde be firme and ratefied. Farther, <hi>Paule</hi> in that ſentence ſpake of gyftes and calling, whych come vnto men by the eternal predeſtination of God, and not of thoſe which are geuen but onely for a time. Wherefore ſeing God had not for the cauſes before rehearſed, caſt out the Iſraelites from the lande of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> the gift remayned ratefied and whole. And <hi>Iiphtahs</hi> argument draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of it, hath his ſtrength and ſure foundacion. Moreouer it may alſo ſeeme that God gaue that lande vnto the Iſraelites in the name of a dowry: for he woulde after a ſorte wedde vnto hymſelfe the Churche of the Iewes,<note place="margin">The land was geuen vnto the Iſraelits with out any iniury to the Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</note> and geue vnto it ſomewhat for a dowry.

                  <p>He addeth farther the third argument, deriued from preſcription: <hi>VVe haue now</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>poſſeſſed thys lande three hundred yeares.</hi> Therefore thou doeſt vs iniury, in requiring it now of vs at the laſt.</p>

                  <p>In the tyme of <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> (as I remember) theſe beganne fyrſt to bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, ſo that <hi>vſucapio</hi> taketh place in thinges moueable,<note place="margin">What differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is betwene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſucapio.</note> and preſcription in thinges vnmoueable. But thus much by the way. But in our hiſtorye this is to be marked, that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> doth wiſely deuide his argumentes: for he doth not firſt place the lawe of preſcription, but before all thinges hee obiecteth the right of warre, afterward the gift of the true God: and his cauſe beyng ſo confirmed, at the laſt he vſeth the lawe of preſcription. And that hee doth therefore, bicauſe a poſſeſſion continued, doth not by it ſelfe and alone preſcribe:<note place="margin">What thynges are required to the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcription.</note> but it hath neede of a good title, and an vpright faith. A good title is, that the thing bee gotten by right order and lawfull manner. For he that hath gotten anye thing by theft or rapine, although he haue long poſſeſſed it, yet it preſcribeth not. But if both the title be good, and his faith vpright, and continuance of tyme bee added, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is firme and good. If we haue gotten any thing, eyther by bying, or by gift, or by inheritaunce, or ſuche lyke wayes, the tytle is good: but farther wee haue neede of an vpright fayth, whereby we are aſſured in our ſelues, that no mans right is iniured, and that we know that there is nothing which maye by iuſt meanes let vs. Wherefore <hi>Iiphtah</hi> hath a good tytle, the ryght of warre, and the gyft of God. He poſſeſſeth alſo with an vpryght fayth, bycauſe hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth neyther fraude nor rapine. Wherefore he very well vſeth the lawe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                  <p>But the tyme of preſcription in thinges moueable,<note place="margin">Of the tyme of preſcription.</note> is as touching our ciuill lawes three yeares: but in thinges vnmoueable, tenne or twentye yeares, if ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce happen not. For if the owner knowe that it is his owne thyng which is poſſeſſed of an other, and he hold his peace ſo long, hee cannot afterwarde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde it againe. And the lawe ſeemeth iuſtlye to puniſhe ſuche negligence. But if the owner be ignoraunt, the tyme is farther proroged, namely to thirtye or fortye yeares. And this is done when ignoraunce happeneth, and that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth it for himſelfe, and not for an other: otherwyſe it is no preſcription. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit thys we muſt knowe by the waye, that the Eccleſiaſticall Canons, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching preſcription, doo differ from the ciuill lawes. For they, as we haue ſayde, doo appoynt thirtye yeares, though the poſſeſſor be of an euyll fayth. For they determine that euyll faythe cannot let preſcription. But as it is had in the .vi. <hi>De regulis iuris,</hi> chapter <hi>Poſſeſſor.</hi> A poſſeſſor of an euil faith, preſcribeth by long<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of tyme. For we ſhould haue a reſpect vnto the woorde of God, and wyth what conſcience a man may poſſeſſe any thing. Theſe thinges haue I alledged, that we might vnderſtand, how <hi>Iiphtah</hi> vſeth the law of preſcription.</p>

The ciuil lawes aſſigne vnto cuſtome ten or twenty yeares, the Canons, thirty or forty yeares. But moſt firme is that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,<note place="margin">Cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word of God, is of no force.</note> the memorye of whoſe beginning is not extant amonge men. And this ought to be firme, that thoſe thinges which are againſt the woord of God, do by no meanes preſcribe. Wherfore that which the Papiſtes affirme, namelye that the Communion hath bene geuen but vnder one kinde thys foure hundreth or fyue hundreth yeares: bicauſe it is manifeſtlye againſt the woorde of God, they cannot proue that it is preſcribed by cuſtome. For ſuche a thyng is not (as you would ſay) preſcriptable. By whiche ſelfe ſame meanes they can not bring the cuſtome of the ſole lyfe of Miniſters, as preſcript: for it was at the begynning extort by violence,<note place="margin">Hoſtienſis.</note> and it is againſt the woorde of God: althoughe <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> ſaith, that the power of Cuſtome is ſo great, that it compelleth Prieſtes to ſole lyfe,<note place="margin">What cuſtome is vicious.</note> in the diſtinction .xxiii. chapter <hi>Placuit.</hi> But, as the ciuill lawes determine, that Cuſtome is vicious, which eyther is againſt nature, or els agaynſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawe. But that which I haue affirmed, hath hys foundacion in the holye Scriptures. For when Chriſt ſayd vnto the Phariſeis: Hipocrites, why violate ye the commaundement of God, bicauſe of your own tradicion? For God ſaith: Honour thy father, and thy mother. But you ſay: whoſoeuer ſayth to father or mother: The gyft. &amp;c. they might haue preſcribed vnto hym cuſtome, but it was not lawful, bicauſe it was manifeſtly againſt the woord of God.</p>
                  <p>In the country of <hi>Taurus</hi> there was a cuſtome, to kyll ſtraungers and geſts. The <hi>Perſians</hi> had a cuſtome, neuer to deliberate of waighty matters, but in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, and when they were dronke. Among the <hi>Sauromates</hi> there was a cuſtome, that when they were drinking, they ſolde their daughters. Theſe preſcribe not, when as they are manifeſtly vicious and euyll. But that cuſtome preſcribeth, which is neither againſt the woord of God, nor the law of nature, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. For the right of cuſtome commeth of the approbation, and ſecrete aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people.

But as it is ſayde, when they are againſte the woorde of God, or againſte nature, or the common lawe, they do not preſcribe. For then are they not cuſtomes, but beaſtly cruelties.</p>

But if we would, now that the Church is conſtituted, worſhyp God after the ſame maner, we ſhould both be derided &amp; laughed at, &amp; alſo it wer not to bee ſuffred.

This is (as he thinketh) a full definition. But in that he ſaith: That that vſe ought to be agreeing with reaſon, it is not ſufficient, but firſt it is to be ſayd, that it ought to agree with the worde of God, for that is to be counted for the chiefeſt reaſon. Afterward, it muſt be allowed by the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people: for as much as it is not ſufficient, that it be done ether raſhly, or of neceſſity, or for ſome other cauſe, but it ought alſo to be allowed by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and inſtitution of the people, and of whoſe beginnyng there is no mention, or that it is preſcribed by a iuſt tyme, and appoynted by the lawes, neither is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by any contrary action.

But as I haue ſaid it is an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous &amp; confuſed vowe. For what if ſuch a thyng ſhould haue met him as myght neither haue ben ſacrificed, nor dedicated to the Lorde? What if a dogge had met <hi>Iiphtah</hi> at his returne, as it is a louing beaſt, and oftentymes meeteth his Lord returnyng home. But it is an vncleane beaſt, neither may it be ſacrificed, nor re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demed with any price. It is wonderfull that ſo great a Captayne was ſo ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the law of God, that he vowed not more diſtinctly. It may be ſayd that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites had ſo longe tyme worſhipped <hi>Baal</hi> vnder the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they had forgotten the worſhipping of the true God. But eſpecially <hi>Iiphtah</hi> which was both a baſtard, and a baniſhed man, and alſo a man of warre, which kinde of men do not ſo much thinke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lawes. Wherfore he voweth, but not according to the preſcript of the lawe.<note place="margin">It was lawful to vowe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto God.</note> But we muſt knowe that it was lawfull for the Iewes to vowe menne alſo vnto GOD, and to dedicate them vnto hym. Yea and the redemption of manne is ſeaſed in the lawe by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of kynd and age. <hi>Hanna</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> dedicated him from a childe to the deuine worſhyppyng, and it is very likely that <hi>Helkana</hi> her huſbande al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the vowe.</p>
                  <p>But that which Interpreters ſay of the virginity of the daughter of <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> it cannot be gathered by the woordes of the hiſtory. Yea rather it is not true: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome Rabines were of that opinion, but yet without example and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the woord of God, I know that that <hi>Hanna,</hi> of whom <hi>Luke</hi> maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, was dayly in prayers, and other women for praiers ſake, watched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at the Tabernacle, and that the ſonnes of <hi>Hely</hi> accompanied with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them, but the ſcripture teſtifieth not of any that vowed chaſtity, neither did God in the olde Teſtament euer ſpeake anye thing of thys kynde of vowe. Wherfore this ſentence: <hi>And <hi>I</hi> wyl offer it for a burnt offring,</hi> is an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, for it expoundeth and contracteth the firſt part of the Oration: <hi>It ſhalbe the Lordes.</hi> How ſhal it be the Lordes? He declareth howe, when hee addeth: And I wil offer it for a burnt offring. Other make <hi>Vau</hi> a diſiunctiue,<note place="margin">The vowe of Iiphtah was vnwarly made</note> as I haue before touched. But that is not certayne. Neither is the vow therfore excuſed, but that it was vnwarely made. For there mought eaſely haue met him a dogge (as I before admoniſhed) whiche could neither be ſacrificed vnto GOD, nor dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto hym.</p>

Wherefore they were called calfes of the lippes, whiche a man had promiſed to God, not onely in mynde, but alſo in voyce. <hi>And <hi>I</hi> can not go backe</hi> (ſayeth he.) It is meruelous why he ſhould ſay ſo. For in the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> are many thynges wrytten of the redeemyng of vowes, whiche I wyll thus gather into a fewe. If any had vowed a man, it was lawfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme hym with a pryce, and there was an eſtimation ſet. And therefore it was called the vowe of eſtimation. For they vowed either themſelues, or theyr ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, or theyr children, and it was lawfull for euery manne to vowe them which he had in hys power. From twenty yeares vpwarde to ſixty, they payd for the male fifty ſicles, for the female <hi>.30.</hi> From fyue yeares vpwarde to twenty, for the male they payd twenty ſicles, and for the female tenne. If a manne had vowed a houſe vnto GOD, and would redeme it, the houſe was eſtemed, and the redemer added the fifth parte beſides the pryce. If a manne had vowed a fielde, the eſtimation was taken of the ſeede thereof, an Homer of Barly was eſteemed at fifty ſicles of Siluer. And how much nearer the yeare of Iubile was, ſo muche the more was there abated of the pryce. A cleane beaſt beyng once vowed ought vtterly to be ſacrificed, neither mought it be redemed: but if it had ben vncleane, it might haue ben redemed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſeyng GOD did ſo diligently prouide for the redeemyng of vowes, howe doth <hi>Iiphtah</hi> ſaye, that hys vowe can not be reuoked? This maye bee aunſwered two wayes. Firſte it myght bee, that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> as he was a man of warre, ſo was he ignoraunte of this manner of redeemyng of vowes.<note place="margin">Note the two manner of vowes.</note> An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waye it maye bee aunſwered, that he promiſed not the vowe of eſtimation, but <hi>Cherem,</hi> that is a curſe. And thys kynde of vowe neuer returned to hys owner, neither could it be conuerted to a prophane vſe.<note place="margin">Two kynds of the vowe Che<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rem.</note> A fielde after thys man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dedicated, was alwayes appoynted for the tabernacle: yea and aſſes and horſes ſerued the Lorde, neyther could they be redemed. So if a man had vowed to be a Nazarite all hys lyfe tyme, he was neuer redemed: althoughe that were not in vſe. And vnto thys kynde of vowe pertayned, if a man had made himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>Cherem,</hi> bycauſe he neuer returned into libertye. With ſuche a vowe was the City of Iericho bounde, neyther was it lawfull for the Iewes to touche any of the thyngs that were without life, pertaynyng to the City whiche were vnder this vowe. Therefore <hi>Achan</hi> ſinned moſt grieuouſly, whiche tooke to hymſelfe ſome parte thereof. But there was an other kynde of <hi>Cherem,</hi> whiche was not vowed but vowed to the death vnto the Lorde, and what ſoeuer was after this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> maner vowed vnto the Lord, the ſame ought without redemption to be ſlayn: ſo were the <hi>Amalekites</hi> vowed, and <hi>Saul</hi> moſt bitterly reprehended, bycauſe he had ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> their kyng, and ſaued ſome of their oxen on lyue. Wherfore it may be that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> vowed, that whatſoeuer thing met hym firſte out of hys houſe when he returned, ſhould be ſlayne. But he was very much deceaued: for thys kynde of vowe had not place, but in wicked men, and ſuch as were declared to be the enemyes of God: therefore he was not bounde by this lawe of vowes to ſlaye hys daughter. Wherefore in that he ſayeth, <hi>I can not call backe,</hi> if we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande it generally of vowes, it is not true, bycauſe it was lawful to redeme them, but if we haue a reſpect vnto <hi>Cherem,</hi> the perſon vowed ought to be ſlaine,

                  <p>But here aryſeth a doubt: Why God heard this vowe, when as it was vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly vowed. I aunſwere. I doubt not but that God gaue the victory: but that it was geuen for the vowe, it is not founde by the wordes of the Hyſtory: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould be compelled to allowe this vowe. The daughter doth in deede obey the father, but in the meane tyme ſhe requireth a litle ſpace, namely of two monethes, that ſhe might together with her fellow virgins comfort her ſelf, and bewayle her virginity.

But it is, not very likely, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not then Counſell of ſo weighty a matter, or that they tolde hym not that he myght haue redemed hys vowe. Neither is it probable that thys <hi>Iiphtah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted any thyng raſhely. when as the Epiſtle to the Hebrues calleth hym ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If thou wilt ſaye: He did vnto her as he had vowed, but he had vowed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and to offer what ſoeuer mette hym, they wyll aunſwere: He vowed in deede, but vpon this condition, ſo that it were lawfull. But when his daughter met him, either he learned, or els he vnderſtood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was not lawfull. Wherfore if he had killed her, he had not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed his vowe, but ſhould haue contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hymſelfe. But on the contrary part it ſeemeth wonderfull that he was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed, and rente hys garmentes, if the mayden ſhoulde not haue bene offred vp. Farther, what ſhoulde the virgines haue lamented her? For if ſhe ſhoulde not haue bene ſlayne, there ſeemed no iuſte cauſe of mournyng. Moreouer if her virginitye ſhoulde haue bene offred vnto GOD, it ſhoulde haue bene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen wyth a wyllynge mynde and not wyth an vnwyllyng mynde:<note place="margin">What is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded in vowes.</note> and in rendryng vowes thys thyng was chiefely regarded, to render them wyllyngly and with a chierefull mynde. Beſides theſe thynges, <hi>Iiphtah</hi> had no example
<pb facs="tcp:18396:200"/> in the ſcriptures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was lawfull for the father to binde his daughter by a vow, to kepe her virginity: but God contraryly promiſeth aboundaunce of children vnto the obſeruers of the law, in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the .7. and <hi>Exodus</hi> the .23. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore that which God promiſed in the place of a great benefite, the ſame could not be hyndred by a vowe. Farthermore, the arguments of the <hi>Rabines</hi> are cold and weake, as afterward ſhalbe more aboundantly declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> in his .1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the .7. chapter writeth: If the father ſhall determine firmely in his hart, hauing power ouer his owne will, to keepe his virgine vnmaried, he doth well, &amp;c. Why writeth he hauing power ouer his owne will? If the mayden her ſelfe will, the father may kepe her vnmaried, ſo that ſhe conſent. But <hi>Iiphtah</hi> knew nothing of the will of his daughter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vowed, wherfore he ought not to thinke his vow to be ratified, when his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter met him. And if this kynd of vowe was not firme in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it was of much les value in the olde Teſtament, where the vowe of virginity was not knowen. But of this thing I haue ſpoken more in my litle booke of Vowes.</p>
                  <p>There were other whiche thought that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> did in very dede offer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which in theſe tymes ought not to ſeme ſo new and vnaccuſtomed a thing. For God required of <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his ſonne, and ſuch a vow was thought of many to be moſt acceptable vnto God, and that opinion alſo did ſpread abrode among the Ethnikes wherfore, this ſentence is often ſpoken: Thou haſt aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the windes with bloud, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgin ſlayne. There are workes of Poetes whiche make mencion of <hi>Pollixena</hi> &amp; <hi>Iphigenia:</hi> &amp; alſo Hiſtoryes of the <hi>Curtians</hi> and <hi>Decians.</hi> And vndoubtedly with this expoſition agreeth the <hi>Chaldey</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt, which among the Hebrues is in a maner in the ſame eſtimation and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that the holy ſcriptures are in. That Paraphraſt ſayth, that the mayden was immolated: &amp; reproueth <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> bycauſe he aſked not counſell of the hyghe prieſt. And the ſame thing do al the auncient <hi>Rabines</hi> thinke, which alſo reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the highe prieſt, bicauſe he of his own accord went not vnto <hi>Iiphtah. Ioſephus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is of their opinion.<note place="margin">Ioſephus. <hi>Chriſoſtome.</hi> Ierome.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> alſo writeth many thinges of this matter, but altogether farre from the Hiſtory: he followeth allegories, ſo that in a maner no certaynty can be gathered out of him. But <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth agaynſt himſelfe. In his Epiſtle to <hi>Iulianus,</hi> he ſayth that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was numbred among the ſayntes, bycauſe he offred his daughter. But in his .1. boke agaynſt <hi>Iouinianus</hi> he writeth, after the minde of the Hebrues, that bycauſe he made an euil vowe by the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, he felt his error in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of his daughter. For there mought haue met hym either a dogge, or an aſſe, whiche had hen wicked to haue offred: and ſo in one place he prayſeth that, whiche in an other place he diſpraiſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note>
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his .3. booke <hi>de Virginitate</hi> ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mayden was in very deede immolated, &amp; he writeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Iiphtah</hi> vowed not before the battaile, but in the fight, &amp; in the very conflict, when things were doubtfull. And he addeth: I do not allow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murther, but I ſe a laudable feare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would not violate his promiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had made. And he ſaith moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this act is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the worke of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> when he was about to kill his ſonne, the Lord cried out vnto him: Now I know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou loueſt me. And he concludeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the ſame maner may <hi>Iiphtah</hi> be praiſed, bycauſe he ſhewed by his example, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the oracle of god, wherin he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vowes ſhould be performed, was to be preferred before childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although the onely begotten child ſhould be killed. But he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, whether God haue a reſpect vnto perſons, whiche letted <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould not offer vp his ſonne, but with ſtoode not <hi>Iiphtah.</hi> He denieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God accepteth perſons, but it behoued (ſaith he) to declare vnto <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he delighted not in humane ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Afterward ſucceded the law, which in <hi>Deut.</hi> &amp; <hi>Leui.</hi> prohibited the immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of children. Wherfore the will of god was already declared both in <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; in the law, wherfore there neded no new oracle, or new prohibition. Farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he noted that in <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was not that perfection whiche was in <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:18396:200"/> For <hi>Abraham</hi> wept not, tare not his garmentes, deferred not two monethes, but ſtrayghtwaye went, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> followed hym. Therefore it is no meruayle (ſayth he) if God prohibited not <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> for ſo muche as he woulde puniſhe hys longe taryeng.</p>
                  <p>And in his thyrd booke <hi>de officiis</hi> the .12. chapter, he writeth: I will neuer be perſuaded but that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> vowed vnaduiſedly, for ſo muche as he afterwarde repented. And he addeth that in deede he alloweth not the acte, but he ſayeth that in a godly feare he fulfylled his vowe, but in ſuche ſorte, that he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his poſterity to lament it. He ſayeth farther, I can not accuſe the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bycauſe it was neceſſary for hym to paye that whiche he had vowed, but it is a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſitye (ſayeth he) whiche is payed with parricide: and it is better not to vowe, that thyng whiche he wyll not, vnto whome thou voweſt. And ſtrayght way he ſaith: All promiſes are not to be kept: for eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god alſo ſometymes chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his will. By which wordes he alludeth vnto the place whiche is written in <hi>Numbers</hi> the .14. chapter, of the prayers of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is vtterly of that ſentence, to thinke that the mayden was offred: and for that cauſe (as I haue ſayde) preferreth her before the two <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorians.</hi> And of her he ſayeth in hys exhortation to virgins: She payed with her bloude the vnaduiſed vowe of her father. And vpon the firſte Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the .15. chapter he ſayth: In a thyng whiche could not be acceptable, he was founde faythfull, offryng his daughter, as he had fooliſhely vowed. And agayne. The acte is not allowed, but the perſeueraunce of fayth is worthy to be brought foorth for an example to followe.</p>
                  <p>But theſe wordes of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> are not ſo lightly to be paſſed ouer:<note place="margin">What thynges are to be noted in the woordes of Ambroſe.</note> for they can not be ſimply allowed, and as they be ſpoken of hym. Yet haue I brought them, to ſhewe that he thought that the mayden was offred in very deede. But in hys woordes thys firſte I marke, that he affirmeth a certayne godly feare to be in <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> whereby he was led to performe his vowe: and that children were not to be preferred before Religion: thirdly that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was found faythfull in that thyng, whiche coulde not be acceptable vnto God. Laſtly that hys perſeuerance of fayth is brought foorth for an example to followe.</p>
                  <p>As touchyng the firſt, I knowe not, how that may ſeeme a godly feare, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> driueth a man to parricide: for he calleth that kyllyng parricide,<note place="margin">Godly feare dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth not a man to commit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide.</note> and that three or foure tymes. Ther are in dede affections in vs which are grafted by god, but yet to vertues, and to do well. A feare, to eſchewe ſinnes. An anger, to puniſhe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actes, &amp;c. Wherfore feare, when it is applied vnto vertue, may be called god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but if it ſerue for vice, it can not ſeme godly, yea rather,<note place="margin">What affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to bee cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted godly.</note> it hath a certayne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vngodlines. Otherwyſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> endeuor of Idolatrers might be prayſed: for we ſee them diligently labor to worſhip god, but bycauſe they apply not themſelues to the ſincere worſhippyng of God, their endeuour can not be called godly. So when that feare of <hi>Iiphtah</hi> draue him to commit parricide, howe could it be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? If thou wilt ſay that by parricide he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not the ſinne, or the wicked acte, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his daughter: I will demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, why he ſayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he alloweth not the acte? vndoubtedly if he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not allowe it, then perceaueth he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſinne.</p>
                  <p>But in that he ſayth: That the loue of children is les to be eſtemed them Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. That is true: but that was no religion, but a fooliſhe vnaduiſed, and raſhe vowe. Neither is the loue of children to be les eſtemed then ſuch religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he ſayeth, that he was founde faythfull. But what fidelity is there in that thyng, whiche coulde not be acceptable to God? If my ſeruaunt ſhould do that whiche I had forbidden hym, can he therin ſeme faythfull?</p>
                  <p>But in that he calleth the vnchaungeable mynde of <hi>Iiphtah</hi> conſtancy, in my iudgement he erreth, when as rather it was wilfulnes, wherby he would nedes fulfill that whiche he had vnaduiſedly vowed: neither can perſeuerance in an euill thyng bee called conſtancy. He attributeth vnto hym a feare, whiche alſo he
<pb facs="tcp:18396:201"/> calleth a godly feare, and yet afterwarde he ſayth that he repented. If he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hym, he dyd agaynſt his conſcience: but no man ought to doo any thyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt it. For what is not of fayth, is ſinne. Farther, if he repented, why amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he not hys faulte? For if any thyng had ben done raſhely, that ought to haue ben amended. If GOD (as he ſayeth) doo ſometymes chaunge his ſentence, why then is it not lawfull for vs to chaunge a ſentence that is not ryght? After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde he ſayth: he can not but prayſe <hi>Iiphtah.</hi> But what will he prayſe? An vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpect vowe? But that ought rather to bee reprehended. What, wyll he prayſe the performaunce of the vowe? But that he calleth parricide, neyther can that bee prayſed. I ſaye therefore that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> affirmeth, that the mayden was in very deede immolated: and yet are not al hys wordes to be allowed.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note>Let vs heare nowe what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth of thys thyng. In hys queſtion 29. vpon thys booke he writteth that out of this place, the enemyes of the olde Teſtament, ſnatche occaſion to ſpeake euill of GOD the creator of the world. For they called hym both an euyll GOD, and a cruell. Suche were the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Valentinians, Marcionites,</hi> and ſuche lyke peſtilences. When he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (ſaye they) in the bloude of manne, howe can he not but bee cruell? <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> aunſwereth:<note place="margin">God reioyſeth not in bloud.</note> So farre is it of that GOD reioyſeth in the bloude of man, that he reioyſeth not euen in the bloude of beaſtes: onely he ſuffred for a tyme that ſacrifices of beaſtes ſhoulde be offred, by lytle and lytle to inſtructe men. But what the Sacrifices of the Elders ſignified, whiche ſerued to theyr erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that place,<note place="margin">What the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſignified.</note> he declareth not, but I will in fewe woordes ſhewe it. Firſt was ſet foorth in thoſe Sacrifices, that the rewarde of ſinne is death. And that dyd he after a ſorte teſtifie, whiche brought the Sacrifice, namely that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to be kylled, but by the goodnes of GOD hys death was tranſferred to the Sacrifice. By thys meanes were the Elders inſtructed, that they ſhould eſchewe ſynnes. Farther, thoſe Sacrifices directed the myndes of menne vnto Chriſte, and they were certayne viſible ſermons of hym, and taught that Chriſt ſhoulde bee that Sacrifice whiche ſhoulde take awaye the ſinnes of the worlde, and vpon whom our death and damnation ſhould be tranſferred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">God mought haue required humane ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</note>Wherefore GOD of hymſelfe delyghted not in bloude, but by thys ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng he inſtructed his people.

For what ſhould haue letted hym, or what iniury ſhoulde he haue doone vs, if he woulde haue had Sacrifices of menne offred vnto hym? For manne muſt needes ſometymes dye. Wherefore to preuent the tyme one yeare or two, it woulde not haue bene ſo grieuous, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhoulde he haue doone vs any iniurye, chiefly when we ſhoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that with hym we ſhoulde lyue for euer. Vndoubtedly in thys thyng no manne coulde haue accuſed GOD as cruell. But nowe ſeyng he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued all thoſe holy ſeruices, he manifeſtly teacheth that he reioyſeth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bloude of menne,<note place="margin">God woulde haue the firſte borne of menne redemed, and not ſacrificed.</note> nor in the bloude of beaſtes.

In <hi>Deuteromy</hi> the .12. chapter he ſayeth: The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whiche I wyl expell before thee, doo Sacrifice theyr ſonnes and daughters: but ſee that thou do not ſo.</p>

                  <p>The ſcripture only maketh mencyon of this acte, but praiſeth it not: as alſo it is there written that <hi>Iudas</hi> had to do with his daughter in law, but it is not allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.

Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayth he, <hi>Gideon</hi> did before after a ſort tempt God, &amp; yet he had the victory. So much of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I would ſay otherwiſe. For I agree not with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to thinke that <hi>Gidion</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted God.

And we wil graunt that the ſprite of the lord came vpon him, but we haue alredy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted that it was the ſpirite of ſtrength. And although the ſprite of the Lord was vpon him, yet is it not of neceſſitye that he did all thinges by that ſpirite. For we alſo which are Chriſtians, haue the ſprite of Chriſt, when as yet none of vs is renewed in all partes, yea rather we all very oftentimes ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> addeth moreouer, that although the fathers ſometimes ſinned, yet if nothinge letteth, but that god maye vſe theyr ſinnes, to ſignifye thoſe thinges whych myght inſtructe the people. For god is ſo good, that euer of ſinnes he pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out laudable commodities, and maketh them alligorically to declare what
<pb facs="tcp:18396:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſemeth profitable vnto hym. As in that <hi>Iudas</hi> played the whoremonger with his doughter in law, it ſignified that god would couple vnto himſelf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, which before was an harlot: ſo alſo maye it be, that by this acte of <hi>Iiphtah</hi> he ſignified, that god ſo loued mankinde that he would geue his onely begotten ſonne vnto the death for it: for he did not in vaine, and without any cauſe ſuffer ſuch a thing to be don by the fathers. Although they greuouſly ſinned, yet god could vſe their actions to the inſtruction of his people. They were amaſed at the ſacrifices of beaſts, neither did they as it was mete, lift vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of their minds vnto chriſt. Wherfore god would by this meanes ſtirre vp the ſluggiſh, that they ſhould be enduced by the humayne ſacrifice of <hi>Iiphtahs</hi> daughter to thinke vpon Chriſt. For he ſhould geue his lyfe, and be made a ſacrifice for mankinde.</p>
                  <p>Farthermore, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> toucheth a reaſon whereby he defendeth the acte of <hi>Iiphtah.</hi> It may be ſaid, ſaith he, that he was moued by the ſprite of god to make a vow, and led by the ſame ſpirite to performe it. Wherfore he is the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of prayſe, ſo far is it of, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he ſhoulde be reproued. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cannot be gathered by the wordes of the hiſtory. But that whych ſome ſaye, as we haue before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, he wepte, tare his garments, and was excedingly ſorye: therefore he was not moued by the ſprite of God:<note place="margin">God ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth obedience that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth not affections.</note> this I ſaye doth not muche moue me. For god ſo requireth of vs the duties of piety, that yet he withdraweth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our minds humayne affections. Chriſt himſelf when he ſhould willingly go to dye for our ſakes, ſayd for all that: my ſoule is heauye euen to the death. He prayed alſo, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let his cup go from me. But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> intendeth to declare how <hi>Iiphtah</hi> might be defended: which I alſo would gladly do, if I had any part of the hiſtory to helpe me. But that which followeth in <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is ſpoken to imitate <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The error of Auguſtine.</note> For he writeth: The error of <hi>Iiphtah</hi> hath ſome praiſe of faith, which thinge (as I haue before ſhewed) can not be receaued. For if it were an er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ror, then can it not be aſcribed vnto the mocion of the holye ghoſte. Farther, if it were ſinne, what praiſe of fayth can there be in it? Becauſe he feared not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that which he had promiſed. What if the vowe were not lawfull? Can fayth be there prayſed? Moreouer he ſaith: He declined not from the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, and he hoped that he would haue prohibited him, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> killing of his daughter. He would rather vtterly performe the will of god, then contemne it. Theſe thinges were well ſpoken, if he had bene aſſured of the wil of God. But he was not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it: yea rather god had otherwiſe prohibited it in his lawe. Wherefore if it were an error, it ought not to be prayſed. But if the ſpirit moued him, then was there in it no error. That which he afterward addeth is moſte true, and maketh on my ſyde. Firſte he ſheweth, that it was prohibited that a man ſhoulde kill his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both by the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> and by the law. Farther, why the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens wept, he bringeth the ſame reaſon that I brought, namely, both that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould beware, not to bynd themſelues with ſuch a vow, and that ſo great an obedience of this mayden ſhould not be put in obliuion. Theſe thinges wee haue out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> by which woordes appeareth, that he thoughte that this virgin was in very dede immolated, and not compelled by the vowe of chaſtitye to liue alone. Which ſentence I my ſelfe alſo do altogether allow.</p>
                  <p>They which think otherwiſe, haue not paſſing two or three authors, but I haue many which are on my ſide, and eſpecially the auncient Rabbines, whyche liued at that time, wherin the Chaldey Paraphraſte, and the writinge of the Thalmut was made.<note place="margin">Reaſons which confirme the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> For the Chaldey Paraph. affirmeth, that the mayden was ſlayne. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus, Ambroſius,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin</hi> are of the ſame opinion. And we haue reaſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not to be contemned. Firſt, bicauſe there was no law in the old time, that may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ſhould vow chaſtity: yea rather it was a curſe, if a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had died without children and baren. Yea and god promiſed vnto the hebrewes, if you obſerue my law there ſhalbe no barren woman among you. Neyther is it very lykelye, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> holy men would by theyr vow hinder this promiſe. Farther in all the ſcriptures
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18396:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> reueled by god, there remayneth no example of ſuch a thinge. Alſo by this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we ſhould ſeeme after a ſort to confirme monaſticall vowes, which ar playnly againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures. For <hi>Paule</hi> admoniſheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſhould mary a wyfe. I wil not ſpeak how <hi>Iiphtah</hi> taried not for the conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the mayden before he vowed, without whiche (as I haue before ſhewed) the vowe of Virginity could not be ratified. I haue opened my mouth (ſayth he) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and I cannot go backe. Wherefore he vowed not the Virginitye of the mayden, when as he aſked not counſell of her. To this alſo ſerueth the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of the Virgins, and therewithall the weepinge of the mayden herſelfe. For ſhe deſired, that ſhee mighte with her fellowes bewaile her Virginitye. But if it were a vow, why ſhould ſhe haue lamented it? We vſe to bewayle our ſinnes, &amp; not our vowes. But the cauſe that moued the <hi>Rabbines, Kimhi</hi> &amp; <hi>Ben Gerſon,</hi> was this, becauſe they wil eyther allowe or excuſe the acte of <hi>Iiphtah.</hi> But wee muſt not labor for that: not that we would willinglye vncouer the defaultes of the fathers, but becauſe we ſee that thinges whiche are not well doone, are not to be excuſed. Moreouer, alſo this doth not a litttle moue me, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> this day haue not this vowe of Virginity among them. Wherefore al theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lead me to think that the daughter of <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was in very dede immolated.</p>
                  <p>But if it be demaunded, whyther he ſinned or no in doing this,<note place="margin">The queſtion aunſwered two wayes.</note> it may be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered two manner of wayes. Firſte, bycauſe as he was a man, ſo moughte hee ſeme, as very many of the elders fel. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, it may ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did this by the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulſion of the holy ghoſt, not as though god would haue other men to imitate this act, but that men might by it vnderſtand, that Chriſt ſhould dye for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. It is indifferent for euery man to choſe eyther of theſe aunſweres. But I thinke rather he fell. Nowe reſteth to confute the argumentes of the <hi>Rabbines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that they ſay the mayden was not killed of her father, but only puniſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ciuil death, namely that ſhe ſhould liue a part from the followſhip of men with out a huſband and children, it is not wel ſayd: bicauſe it can not be proued by the holy ſcriptures that there was any ſuch kind of vow in the old time. I know that there were <hi>Nazarites,</hi> whiche abſtained from wyne and ſtronge drinke, and all drinke which would make one dronke: but they abſtained not from matrimony. <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Sampſon</hi> beyng either of them a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> had wiues, and <hi>Samuel</hi> had children, as the holy hiſtory declareth. But departinges from the companye of men, are not altogether to be diſalowed, ſo that of them come ſome fruite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church. Chriſt departed .40. dayes, and faſted:<note place="margin">How depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings from the company of men are allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed or diſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</note> but afterward he returned to inſtruct the people. <hi>Iohn Baptiſte</hi> went a parte, but yet for certayne dayes, &amp; baptiſed and preached. So ſome of the fathers went ſometime a part, wher they gaue themſelues both to prayers and godly meditations, wherby they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the better inſtructed to preach. But I can in no caſe allow the perpetuitye of ſolitarye life: for wee are not borne to oure ſelues, but to other alſo. But that in the olde time there were ſome whiche were <hi>Nazarites</hi> for euer, that was not don by the inſtitution of man, but by the commaundement of God: which thing is written to haue happened to <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Otherwiſe <hi>Nazarites</hi> vowed but onely for a time. Wherfore that which the <hi>Rabbines</hi> clayme, is falſe: for there was no ciuill death by the law, whereby men or women were for euer depriued of matrimonye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kimhi</hi> ſayth that this letter <hi>Vau</hi> maketh ſomtimes a propoſition diſiunctiue. I graunt that the ſame is found in certayne places of the ſcripture. But it is not a fyrme argument, if we ſhall ſay: It is thus founde in ſome places, therfore it is ſo alſo in this place. But rather for the moſt part <hi>Vau</hi> maketh not a diſiunctiue propoſition, but a copulatiue. And vndoubtedly here it is brought in by expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. It ſhalbe the Lords ſayth hee. After what manner? For I will offer it for a burnt offringe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:203"/>
                  <p>Farther they reaſon: The mayden deſyred ſpace of time, wherin to bewayle her virginity: neither ſaith ſhe, her ſoule or life. This argument hath a ſhew, but no ſtrength. For if death be to be lamented, vndoubtedlye then is it muche more to be lamented when it hath a bitter condicion annexed wyth it. The may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den was ſure to dye at ſome certaine time, but that ſeemed vnto her very hard, that ſhe ſhould dye without childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore that condicion is expreſſed, which made the cauſe more miſerable. He ſayth moreouer: It is not writen that <hi>Iiph<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tah</hi> offred her for a burnte offringe, but onelye that he dyd accordynge to hys vow. I aunſwere. That there is ſufficientelye ſayde, when it is ſayde that he did according to his vow. And it is often ſene, that in narrations the ſharpeſt thinges are not expreſſed. And althoughe the woordes be not all one, yet is it ſufficient, if they be equall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leui Ben Gerſon</hi> reaſoneth of this, that it is written, and ſhee knewe no man. Therfore ſayth he, ſhe liued, but maried not. But this reaſon hath no force. For this ſentence is an expoſition of the wordes that go before. For why did the vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gins bewayle her? Becauſe ſhe was vnmaried, and was not coupled to anye manne.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Liranus</hi> ſayth: The ſprite of the Lorde came vpon <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> wherefore he vowed not his daughter for a burnt offring. This reaſon <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (as we haue hearde) aunſweareth. That ſpirite vndoubtedlye was the ſprite of ſtrength and warrelike knowledge. Neither can al that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> afterward did, be ſaid to haue come from the ſame ſpiryte. Moreouer ſayth <hi>Liranus,</hi> ther was twoo monethes ſpace betwene, wherin he aſked counſel of the prieſtes, and thei gaue him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to ſaue his daughter a Virgin. Yea but the auncient Iewes affirme that he was ſo ſtubburne that he woulde not aſke counſell of the prieſtes. And for that cauſe he is reproued by the Chaldey Paraphraſt. Neither is it any newe thinge, that men ſomtimes ſinne, becauſe they thinke not that they haue nede of counſel, and that is wont moſt of al to happen vnto princes. For they haue a high mind and proude ſtomackes, wherfore they think that they haue counſell inough. But he is numbred among the ſayntes. To this <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aunſweareth alſo, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were alſo numbred amonge the Sayntes, whiche yet greuouſlye ſinned. Laſtly he ſaith: If he had ſacrificed his doughter, he ſhould not haue fulfilled, but contaminated his vow. I graunt that. Neither is it any maruaile, that he erred, ſeyng he was a man, and might fall.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhoulde remayne to declare what I thinke of vowes in vniuerſall: but bycauſe of that matter, I haue written aboundauntly in an other place, namely in my Apology againſt <hi>Smith,</hi> therefore I remitte the reader to reade ouer that booke,</p>

For firſt thou ſeeſt ſome, whiche when they beſtowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> benefits, haue onely a reſpect vnto them ſelues. So doo ſhepeheards, neateherds and ſwineheardes, when they prouide paſtour for their cattel, which they haue charge ouer: for there they hunt onely for their owne gayne and commoditye. Otherwiſe they haue no loue to Oxen, ſhepe and ſwine. There be others which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in doing good, haue a regarde both vnto themſelues, and alſo vnto them whom they doo helpe. For the poore doo ſerue ryche men and Princes, partlye by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loue them, and partly to get ſome commodity at their handes. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are to be placed in the third degree, which doo in ſuche ſorte beſtow a benefit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man, that they looke for no recompence of him. It oftentimes happeneth that when we ſee one in miſery, we are touched with mercy, and we helpe him: which without doubt proceedeth of humanity.

The ſeconde is, when they praiſe not, neyther al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thoſe thinges wel of good men, which are wel done vnto them. The thyrde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is of them which doo forget the benefites that they haue receaued.

But theſe men are moſt of all vngrate, foraſmuch as in ſo doing, neither ar men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> onely or other creatures deſpiſed, but God himſelfe is contemned. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer benefites we receaue of men, we haue them of God, which vſeth the labor of men to relieue the miſerable and afflicted.

                  <p>But thou wilt ſay: when men that beſtow benefites,<note place="margin">Whyther bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fites are to bee withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnthankful</note> doo ſomtimes light vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on ingrate perſons, what ought they to doo? Shal they ſtraight way withdraw their benefites from them? Vndoubtedlye they deſerue this: but we muſt not ſo doo ſtraightway, bicauſe men, by reaſon nature is corrupt, are ſlow, neither are they without difficulty moued to doo their duty. Therfore we muſt go forward in wel doing: for he which is not moued to be thankefull with the firſt henefite, ſhal peraduenture be ſtyrred vp with the ſecond, third, forth, or fift. But if he al together ſtycke in his ingratitude, we may iuſtly withdraw from him our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, not moued therunto by hatred or deſyre of reuengement, but that he may be corrected, and that he doo not continually reproche the benefites, which ar the giftes of God. This thing doth God alſo, who by <hi>Hoſeas</hi> the Prophet ſayth vnto

                  <p>Thou wilt aſke perdauenture: why did Chriſt commaund vs, that we ſhould be perfect like our heauenly father: which maketh his ſunne to aryſe as well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the euil,<note place="margin">Twoo kyndes of benefites of God.</note> as vpon the good, and as it is written in <hi>Luke. 6.</hi> chap. He is good to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes the ingrate? I anſwer: That this ſentence of the Lord, is not againſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> definicion now declared. For God hath two kindes of benefites. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which are principal, as the reuelacion of the Goſpell, fayth, iuſtification, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> laſtly glorification or eternal lyfe. Theſe he geueth onely to his. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other temporall and common giftes, whiche yet are in eſpeciall geuen for the electes ſake: but bicauſe without a miracle it is not poſſible that they ſhoulde come vnto the good, vnles the euil be alſo made partakers of them, therefore he geueth them as wel to the one as to the other. How ſhould a ſhowre be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it ſhoulde not moyſten the fieldes of the wicked? God might doo it in deede: but yet not without a miracle. And for as muche as he wyll not alwayes woorke miracles, he wil rather, that the vngodlye alſo ſhoulde bee partakers of theſe benefites, then that the good ſhould be deſtitute of commodities neceſſary for the lyfe.<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> Kinges alſo doo not make euery Citizen a Ruler, a Preſident, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officer longing to a Magiſtrate, but onely them that are iuſt &amp; wiſe: which thing if they doo not, they execute not their office. But when they geue vnto their people lyberall giftes, or a banquet, or diſtribute corne, bicauſe withoute great labour and griefe they cannot ſeperate the good Citizens from the euyll, therfore they beſtow ſuch thinges which are of this kinde, miredly vpon al men, and choſe rather to deſerue wel of euyl citizens, then to defraud the good of their liberality, for whoſe ſakes they are chiefly moued to be bountiful towardes the people.<note place="margin">How we ſhuld behaue our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues toward the ingrate.</note> Let vs alſo imitate this, that when we beſtow priuate thinges, although we light vpon one that is ingrate, let vs not ſtraightway withdrawe from hym our humanity, but let vs behaue our ſelues in ſuch maner, as we haue before de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared, that if he ſtubburnly proceede to be ingrate, let vs at the length ceaſe for his correction, to beſtow any benefite vpon him.

                  <p>But now let vs returne vnto <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> whom the <hi>Ephramites</hi> offended moſt grieuouſly. Firſt, he is accuſed of them, bicauſe he went to the battail and called not them.

But theſe men when they ſawe that by iuſte meanes they coulde not defende that whiche they obiected, they pleade not againſte him at the iudgement ſeate, neither by the order of law, but make a tumult, and ſedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly brag of ſuche complaintes.<note place="margin">The ſaintes ar alwaies wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped wyth newe troubles.</note> And here we ſee the ſtate of holy men ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, how they are alwayes wrapped with new troubles, ſo that they ar almoſt no ſooner paſſed out of one, but an other is at hand. But by the goodnes of God, euen that woorketh to good in vs: for we ar ſo corrupt and viciate, that when thinges go proſperouſly with vs, we are wonderfullye puffed vp, ſo that by our inſolency we are made intollerable: which thing that it ſhoulde not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, God vſeth agayne to exerciſe the elect with troubles, after that he hath grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>We muſt alſo marke the wyſdome of <hi>Iiphtah,</hi> how firſt he woulde proue all thinges, before he woulde take weapons againſt his brethren. Firſt he maketh hys Apologie, wherein he ſayth that he did not raſhlye moue warre, but bycauſe there was a very grieuous contencion betwene him and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and that he was muche oppreſſed by them, and therefore he could not abſtayne from weapons. Farther, he denyeth that he called them not. <hi>I cryed vnto you</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>but when ye ſaued me not, <hi>I</hi> tooke in hande warre my ſelfe, to mine own great daunger.</hi> Wherefore he addeth, that <hi>God delyuered the Ammonites into hys handes,</hi> which myght haue bene a token that God diſalowed not his act. Which kynde of argument is in this place of force, for as much as he attempted no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt thing: otherwyſe there can bee no firme reaſon deriued of it, bycauſe God ſometimes fauoureth the enterpriſes of the vngodly, by reaſon of his counſels, which are alwayes iuſt, but ſometimes hidden from vs. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nabat</hi> was by a ſedicion created king ouer the ten Tribes, and obtayned that which with naughty conſcience he deſired. <hi>Nabuchad-Nezar</hi> alſo fought tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly and ambiciouſlye agaynſt the Hebrues, and obtayned the victorye, when yet no man can allowe thoſe doinges as godly, bicauſe of the ſucceſſe of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ephramites</hi> were not content with this Apology.

                  <p>They alſo violated humane ryght and the lawes: for wyth weapons they inuaded thoſe that were condemned by no ryght, and they woulde take awaye the dominion ouer the <hi>Galaadites</hi> whych was geuen vnto <hi>Iiphtah.</hi>

                  <head>¶Of the vow of the Nazarites.</head>
                  <p>ANd as touching the vow of the <hi>Nazarits</hi> it is manifeſtly ſet forth in the .6. of <hi>Numb:</hi> But thoſe thinges whiche are there written,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the vow of the Nazarites.</note> maye all be reduced to three principall poyntes. The firſte was, that they ſhoulde drinke no wine nor ſtronge drinke, nor any thinge that might make them droonke. An other was, that they ſhould not pole theyr hed: but all that time the <hi>Nazarite</hi> ſhoulde let his heare grow. The third was, that they ſhould not defile themſelues with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge for buriales, no not at the death of theyr father or mother. Theſe thinges were to be obſerued, but not for euer, but onelye for ſome certayne time. For he vowed to bee a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> but for certayne number of dayes, or Monethes, or yeares.</p>
                  <p>But why did God inſtitute theſe thynges?<note place="margin">Why god gaue the inſtitution of the Naza<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rites.</note> There may be many cauſes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Fyrſte, becauſe menne were ſo prone to chuſe vnto themſelues certayne kindes of lyfe, whereby they mighte eaſely fall into ſuperſtition. Therfore God would after this maner bridle them, as though he ſhould haue ſayd: Foraſmuch as ye are ſo prone to your own ſtudies, and to inuent newe woorſhippings, yet ſhall ye not do what ye liſte your ſelues, but what I preſcribe vnto you. And ſo geuinge vnto them the lawe of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> hee kepte them in doynge theyr dewtye.</p>
                  <p>But what mente theſe thinges? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> They ought to keepe theyr heare growinge till the ende of theyr vow. For then in offring ſacrifice, and burninge the fleſhe in fire, they did cut of the heare, and burned it in the ſame fire. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time they were free and returned to theyr old manner of life, which was common al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto other.</p>
                  <p>Some referre theſe thinges vnto an Allegorye, that when the heares were
<pb facs="tcp:18396:208"/> increaſed, the <hi>Nazarites</hi> ſhould conſider, that vertues alſo oughte to increaſe in the minde. But me thinketh there may be an other cauſe rendred, namelye that men ſhould abſtayne from to much trimming and deckinge of the body. For the clipping of the eare much adorneth the body. For <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth in his 1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corrinthians</hi> the .11. Chapter, that to menne it is vncomelye if they let theyr heare growe. Althoughe other reaſons of other menne are not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cyrillus Procopius.</note>
                     <hi>Cirillus</hi> and alſo <hi>Procopius</hi> vpon the booke of Numbers, ſay that theſe thinges were inſtituted of God, to reuoke men from the idolatrous worſhippinges and rites of the Ethnikes, that that which they gaue vnto idols, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes ſhould geue vnto him. So alſo whereas they ſacrificed vnto Idols, he would haue theſe men rather to ſacrifice vnto himſelfe, not that god ſo much regardeth ſacrifices, but to wythdrawe them from idolatry. We reade that the Ethnikes ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred theyr heare to growe, that they mighte afterward conſecrate it, ether vnto the <hi>Nimphes,</hi> or to <hi>Apollo.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Apollo</hi> was by them called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is a nouriſher of the heare. Yea and <hi>Theſeus</hi> (as it is written in <hi>Plutarche</hi>) went to <hi>Delphos</hi> there to dedicate his heare vnto <hi>Apollo.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarche.</note> And children at Rome when they were paſte childehode, offred theyr heare and beardes to ſome God. <hi>Sophocles</hi> writeth that <hi>Oreftes</hi> put his heare in the tombe of his father.<note place="margin">Sophocles</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may alſo be an other cauſe rendred, and that not vayne. For the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites</hi> ought alwayes to be pure, and although they were not of the tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui,</hi> yet they ſo behaued themſelues all that time, as if they had beene prieſtes of the tribe of <hi>Leui.</hi> And the Leuites and prieſtes were prohibited in the .21. chapt. of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> from polinge theyr head. Which thinge maye alſo be perceaued by the .6. chapter of <hi>Baruch.</hi> Ye ſhall ſee (ſayth he) prieſtes in Babilon with theyr heades ſhauen,<note place="margin">The prieſts of the Hebrewes ſhaued not theyr heades.</note> and theyr garmentes cutte. And they were prieſtes of idoles. Wherfore we ſee that by the commaundent of God, the prieſtes of the hebrewes had not theyr heades ſhauen.</p>
                  <p>In the booke of Numbers the 6. chapter, god calleth the heares of the heade a crowne, or as other tranſlate, it a ſeperatiion. But contrarilye the Papiſtes call theyr ſhauing of the head a crowne: ſo do they peruerte all thinges as they liſte themſelues. But what ſhoulde a man ſpeake of them? They care not what they doo. They will haue lights and cenſing in the temples. If thou aſke them why? Becauſe ſay they God vſed them in the olde teſtamente. But in the olde lawe prieſts had wyues: theſe wil haue none. They ſuffred the heares of their head or beard to grow: but theſe men ſhaue both theyr head and beard. Although at this day there is a great contention among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about a long beard, bicauſe the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell of Carthage in the .44.<note place="margin">Concilium Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thaginenſe.</note> chap. is ſondry waies alledged. For in exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plers it is writen <hi>Comam non nutriant nec barba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> that is, They ſhal not ſuffer theyr heare to growe, nor theire beard, but in others it is red: <hi>Nec barbam tondeant,</hi> that is: They ſhall not clip theyr beardes: whether of theſe two ſentences will theſe men follow? For they wil not ſuffer to haue a long beard, leaſt any part (as they ſay) of the ſacrifice ſhould ſtick in it.

Is not this to ſtreyne at a gnat, &amp; to ſwalow down a Camel? Howbeit ſome of them, leaſte they ſhould ſeme to do not very wiſely nor with any reaſon: The cutting of (ſay they) of the heares, ſignifieth that a prieſt muſte cutte of all ſuperfluous thinges.

                     </note> This <hi>Sicera</hi> (as <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth to <hi>Nepotianus</hi>) was a kind of drink much like vnto wyne, which was made eyther of wheat, or of apples, or of dates, or els of other fruites. Farther they were prohibited to eat the huſkes of grapes or kernels, which are taken out of the wine preſſes. They wer alſo commaunded not to drinke <hi>Miſhereth,</hi> which was nothing els then the waſhing of the grapes. For the wine being preſſed out, there was water powred vpon the grapes that were preſſed, which when it was purified, retained ſom ſauor of the wine. That we call the ſecond wine. But the Chaldey interpretation caleth <hi>Sicera</hi> old wine. And it is manifeſt inough, why the <hi>Nazarites</hi> wer forbidden to drinke both wine and ſtrong drinke: for theſe thinges trouble the heade, and ſtirre men vp to luſt, as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his 20. chapter of Prouerbs admoniſheth, wine maketh a mocker, and ſtrong drinke a troubleſome fellow, and whoſoeuer is deceaued therby, ſhal neuer be wiſe. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaythe alſo to the Epheſians the 5. chapter: Be not dronke with wine, wherin is exceſſe: but be filled with the ſprite. Farther the prieſtes in the old law were prohibited to drinke wine before they came to holy ſeruices. Wherefore the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> foraſmuch as they were like prieſtes, ought alſo to ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtayne from wyne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third thing was, that they ſhoulde not defile themſelues with any mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge for the deade. For as we are with ioy to muche lifted vp, ſo ſometimes are we greuouſly troubled with heauines and mourninge. But God woulde haue his miniſters to be voyde of affections, eſpeciallye of the vehementer affections, when as by them men are more greuouſly moued then is mete. Neyther yet wer theſe obſeruations merites, wherin they conſtituted righteouſnes, but they were rites onely and excerciſes, whereby they ſhould after a ſorte be kepte in doinge theyr deuty. For the vow of a <hi>Nazarite</hi> was a certayne ſeperacion from other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But what they did in the meane time, it is not preſcribed: howbeit many thinke that they were commaunded, to endeuour themſelues to the contemplacion and knoweledge of the lawe, and to worſhyppe and call vpon God purelye and ſincerely.</p>
                  <p>We ſe that god by this kind of vowe would inſtruct the people with ſinguler wiſedome. The Philoſophers write that a manne muſte contende, to be able to beholde highe thinges, and wyth his knowledge to embrace whole nature. And that they ſaye canne neuer be done, vnles the affections in vs be tempered, otherwiſe we are verye often caried awaye by anger and luſte. Wherefore God would haue his to be voyd of theſe affections, namely of mourninge, pleaſure, to much care and vexation about the decking of the bodye. For theſe do not a little hinder the tranquility of the mind, and ſpirituall cogitations therof. Wherfore in the olde lawe he inſtituted in a manner to prepare his, that they ſhoulde not come vnapte and vnmete to higher thinges. Vndoubtedly they which are indew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with the knowledge of God, oughte to frame and prepare themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they come to heare the woorde of God, or to receaue the Sacramentes. <hi>Ieremy</hi> in his 4. Chapter hath very wel admoniſhed vs: Breake vp your fallow ground, and ſow not among the thornes. And they vowed this kind of vowe (as we haue ſayd) for a certayne time, either for a yeare or for a moneth, or as euery man thought it moſt profitable for himſelfe: for the natures of menne are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chaunged, and the ſtudies of piety do waxe feable. Therfore they oughte by ſome meanes to be reſtored. Hereof ſprange the departures of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, into ſolitary places for a time. So they whyche gouerned the publike wealth, when they were wery with matters, kept themſelues cloſe oftentimes
<pb facs="tcp:18396:209"/> in fieldes or manors, not to ſleepe, or to geue themſelues to ſluggiſhnes and idle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, but to refreſh theyr mindes, and that they might returne the more prompte and better inſtructed to accompliſh thinges. And the moſt noble Rhethoricians being wearied with pleading cauſes of the law, went ſometimes into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to heare, to talke, to reade ſomwhat, to peruſe ouer the oracions before herd, and ſo by that meanes to returne more learned and readye to the place of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So the <hi>Nazarites</hi> for a certayne time departed from the companye and felloweſhippe of other menne, that they mighte be the better and holier after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to execute the duties of life. Chryſte alſo in the nyghte tyme depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the mountayne: But in the daye tyme he returned vnto the people. And when the Apoſtles returned, whom he hadde ſente foorth to preache, he led them a way for a little while into a deſerte, that they mighte there be quiet, and refreſh themſelues.</p>

                  <p>The woman thought that it had bene ſome godly man whom ſhe had ſene, or a Prophete: for ſhe knew not that it was the aungell of God. <hi>His looke</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>was terrible.</hi> The Hebrewe worde is ambiguous: for it may be turned both terrible and wonderfull. And vndoubtedly the thinges whiche are wonderful, eſpecially deuine things, doo ſtrike into men a feare.

And this matter pertayned partly to thinges deuine, bycauſe it was ſhewed in the name of God, and partly vnto humane thynges, bycauſe it was a matter as touchyng the receauyng and education of a child.</p>
                  <p>She ſayth, ſhe aſked him not whence he was: bycauſe in ſuch viſions men are ſo amaſed, that they are attentiue onely vnto the thynges which are ſpoken, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they any leaſure to enquire of more thinges. So the mother of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, when the Aungell ſaluted her, aſked hym not what his name was, or from whence he came. <hi>Gideon</hi> alſo when he receaued the oracle of the Aungell, for
<pb facs="tcp:18396:211"/> the delyuering of the people, was altogether ſo aſtoniſhed, that he was nothyng inquiſitiue, what his name was. But the woman ſpeaketh theſe thynges by anticipation: for ſhe thought that her huſbande woulde heare, and inquire of hym the truth. Althoughe <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in hys booke <hi>de Antiquitatibus</hi> (as I haue before admoniſhed) ſayeth, that when he hearde the wordes of his wife, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuſpected her of euill.<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> Howit <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in hys .70. Epiſtle, where he very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently entreateth of this Hyſtory, denieth that to be very lykely. For if (ſayeth he) he had ben gelious, God would not haue ſent an aungell vnto hym. But me thinketh <hi>Ambroſes</hi> reaſon is not firme. For <hi>Manoah</hi> might otherwiſe be a good man, although he were touched with ſuſpition. Very good men alſo haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ſome ſuſpition of ſuch things. For euen <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the huſband of <hi>Mary,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Scripture teſtifieth that he was a iuſt man, ſomewhat ſiniſterly ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted hys Spouſe, to whom yet the Aungell appeared.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I rather beleue that <hi>Manoah,</hi> was eyther altogether without gelouſy, or elles not very muche gelous. For he accuſed her not abroade, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated her not, neither vſed he the publique remedy of the lawe: For then was in force that lawe whiche was geuen by GOD, that if a manne ſuſpected his wife of aduoutry, he ſhould bryng her to the doore of the tabernacle, where the Prieſt ſhould ſearche out the honeſty of the woman by ſolemne waters, and by a bitter curſe.<note place="margin">The cauſe of the lawe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.</note> For God would that maryed folkes ſhould lyue together with a mery, quiet, and not ſuſpitious mynde. But <hi>Manoah</hi> dyd not onely not vſe theſe remedyes: but alſo he by no meanes rebuked his wyfe. But ſtrayghtwaye prayed vnto the Lorde, that that man of God would returne the ſeconde tyme, wherby he myght vnderſtand, how the child ſhould be brought vp. Neither dyd he tempt god by hys prayers. In deede no man ought to deſire a ſigne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may beleue the articles of fayth. For thoſe thynges whiche are contayned in them, are already before ſufficiently proued and confirmed by the worde of God, and by miracles. But if there happen any newe and ſingular reuelation, bycauſe there may bee deceates and guiles of deuilles, who tranſforme themſelues (yea euen into the aungelles of lyght) if we require a ſigne of the Lorde or inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſinne not. That a baren woman ſhoulde beare, or that a childe ſhoulde ſet the people at liberty, it was a certayne ſingular thyng. Wherefore <hi>Manoah</hi> prayeth for nothyng curiouſly, and therefore GOD hearde hym. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde demaunded the name of the aungel, but bycauſe he demaunded it curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was not hearde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The aungell came agayne vnto the woman</hi> the ſelfe ſame daye, as all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters doo agree. And vndoubtedly it might be, that firſt he came in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, and the ſecond tyme, either at noone, or about the ſunne ſet. <hi>Manoah</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>VVhether he were the manne whiche ſpake with hys wife:</hi> whiche thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he affirmed vnto hym, he ſayde: <hi>Let thy ſayinge come to paſſe.</hi> It maye be an oration of one that wiſheth, as if he ſhoulde haue ſayde: I woulde to GOD it myght come to paſſe. Or it may by ſuppoſition, as if it ſhoulde haue bene ſayd: If it come to paſſe as thou haſte ſayde, <hi>VVhat then ſhalbe the iudgement of the child?</hi> When he ſaith <hi>iudgement,</hi> he aſketh not Counſel of Aſtronomers, which aunſwere by the ſtarres, what ſhall come to paſſe of a childe. He onely demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what GOD had decreed of the childe. Neither ought the decree of GOD wherof he inquireth, to be referred vnto the merites of the child, but onely vnto the mercye of GOD. For <hi>Miſchpat</hi> is very well turned a decree, for a decree is of mercye and not of merite. The Aungell repeateth vnto hym all thoſe thynges, whiche he had before commaunded the woman to take heede of. <hi>She maye not eate</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>of any thynge that commeth of the wyne grape.</hi>

                  <p>That which we haue called an oblation, in Hebrew it is <hi>Minchah.</hi> But what manner of oblation that was, is vnderſtoode by the <hi>.2.</hi> chapter of <hi>Leuit.</hi> There wer diuers kindes therof, but it euer conſiſted of corne, but yet not alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared after one manner, &amp; it was ſo offred, that ſome part of it was burnt vnto the Lord, the other part was left for the Prieſtes.

                     </hi> writeth, that this was not an aungell, but a man of god, and a Prophet, namely <hi>Pinhas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar.</hi> But he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led angel bycauſe <hi>Manoah</hi> and his wife thought hym to be ſo. For after the ſame maner <hi>Ezras,</hi> although he was a man, yet was he called an aungell. And Chriſt whiche is very man, is called the aungell of the Teſtament. But how he being a man vaniſhed awaye in the flambe, <hi>Leui ben Gerſon</hi> declareth not. But I more ſimply doo iudge him to haue ben an aungell in dede. For <hi>Pinhas</hi> had not a ſecret name, but a name well knowen in his tyme, and the wordes of the texte do tend to this,<note place="margin">Of the name of Elohim,</note> to teache that it was an aungell. <hi>VVe haue ſene the Lord.</hi> In Hebrewe it is <hi>Elohim,</hi> which althoughe it be the name of GOD, yet is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to aungelles, yea and alſo to prynces and Prophetes, accordyng to that ſaying: I haue ſayde, ye are Goddes.

                     </hi> if he would haue deſtroyed vs. Wherfore ſeyng our ſacrifice was accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him, he counteth not vs as enemyes. But whereby knew ſhe that that ſacrifice was acceptable vnto GOD. Firſte, bycauſe the Aungell had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it to be done, which vndoubledly he would not haue don, vnles he had vnderſtoode that it ſhould be acceptable vnto God. Farther, bycauſe the flambe had conſumed the Sacrifice, and the angel therewithall flewe away, as though he caried vp the ſacrifice with him into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. An other argument is: <hi>He would not haue taught vs ſo many and ſuch thyngs,</hi> if we ſhould periſhe. He came vnto vs once or twiſe, and inſtructed vs of thynges whiche we ſhould doo. Wherfore be of good comforte, we ſhall not dye.</p>

And firſte that God more accepteth hym that offreth, then he doth the Sacrifice: yea the oblations pleaſe not hym, but for the offerers ſake. This ſentence <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proueth by the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in his fourth booke, and .34. chapter. For God had a regarde vnto <hi>Abel,</hi> and to his giftes, but vnto <hi>Cain</hi> and his giftes he looked not, bycauſe of the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that offred. For looke what manner of will he that offreth hath towardes God, the lyke will hath God to the oblation. Chriſt alſo ſayth: If thou bryng thy gifte vnto the aulter, and remembreſt that thy brother hath ſomwhat agaynſt thee, go and reconcile thee firſt vnto thy brother: and then come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy gifte. As thoughe he ſhould ſay: If whyleſt thou art euill, and enemy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god, thou doeſt offer, thyne oblation ſhall not be acceptable vnto God. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> concludeth,<note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note> that they are not ſacrifices whiche ſanctify, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of him that offreth. And he addeth a reaſon: bycauſe God nedeth not our Sacrifice. Among men, the euill may oftentymes be abſolued: bycauſe men are ſometimes couetous and nedy, and are eaſely wonne with money. But if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Iudge to be both iuſte and good, he will reiecte the money, neither wyl he ſuffer his equity after that manner to be blotted. So God, bycauſe he can not be wonne by flattery, obſerueth the mindes of men, and not the Sacrifices. In <hi>Eſay</hi> the .66. chapter, he ſayth: He that ſacrificeth a ſhepe, is as if he ſlewe a dog: not that god hateth ſacrifices in vniuerſal, but bycauſe he alloweth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18396:213"/> of euill men. I haue the largelier ſpoken thinges, bicauſe the papiſtes boaſt, that in maſſes they offer Chriſt vnto God the father: which thinge if it ſhould be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, then muſt god the father more eſteme a noughty ſacrificer, then he doth his ſonne. But this woman reaſoneth moſt wittely. God hath receaued our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, therfore he is not angry, neyther wil he deſtroy vs.</p>
                  <p>We count the ſacrifices of chriſtians to be a contryte heart, prayers,<note place="margin">The ſacrifices of Chriſtians.</note> geuinge of thankes, almes, mortifienge the affections of the fleſhe, and ſuche like. Theſe are lefte vnto vs after the abrogation of the carnall ſacrifices, that wee ſhoulde offer them as the fruites of our faythe, and teſtimonies of a thankefull minde. But as touching the pacifieng of God, Chriſte offred himſelfe once vpon the croſſe, neither is there any nede that any man ſhould offer him againe. For by an oblation he acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed al thinges. Now remayneth, that we embrace his ſacrifice with fayth, and we ſhall haue God mercifull vnto vs, who of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes will by Chriſt accept thoſe ſacrifices which we haue now made mencion of. But <hi>Auguſtine contra literas Parmeniani,</hi> in his .2. booke and .8. chapter ſeemeth at the fyrſt ſight to make agaynſt vs.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> For the <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> woulde not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the other Chriſtians, becauſe they counted them defiled and vnpure, and they cited a place out of <hi>Iohn:</hi> Wee knowe that God heareth not ſinners. Your men, ſayd they, haue betrayed the holye bookes, haue burnte incenſe vnto Idoles, haue denied god, how then wil god heare them? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aunſwereth, that it may be, that an euill miniſter, although he be not hearde for his owne cauſe, yet when he prayeth for the people, he maye be hearde. And he confirmeth his ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the example of <hi>Balaam:</hi> for he being a moſt wicked man, prayed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to god and was heard. But if a man diligentlye examine theſe thinges, he ſhall finde that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is not againſt vs, although at the firſt ſight he ſemeth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to preſſe vs.</p>

For there muſte bee one certayne manne, whiche maye conceaue the prayers for the reſte, leaſte in the multitude ſhoulde riſe a confuſion or tumulte, if euerye manne ſhoulde by his owne woordes poure out prayers aloude in the Church.

Hereby are we admoniſhed, that whileſt we are preſente at publike prayers, wee muſte take verye diligente heede, and determine that thoſe prayers whyche are recited, are ours.<note place="margin">How it is ſayd that Balaam was heard.</note> But <hi>Balaam</hi> by a certayne forme of prayer propheſied, and therefore his woordes are called a bleſſinge, bycauſe he propheſied happye thinges vnto the people of god.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was not hearde, but the holye ghoſte was the true authour of hys woordes.</p>
                  <p>That whiche is alledged out of Iohn: God heareth not ſinners, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth that that was not the ſaying of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Whyther God heareth ſinners</note> but of the blind ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> yet fully illuſtrate. Wherefore he affirmeth that ſentence not to be true in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal. For (as they define) the prayers of peruerſe miniſters ar ſomtimes hard, becauſe they are of the church. But as touching the oblation of Chriſt, I do not think that the papiſts wil graunt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole church offreth it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they wil
<pb facs="tcp:18396:214"/> haue that to be peculiar to the maſſemongers. And though they ſhould graunte that, yet is not the whole Churche greater or more acceptable vnto god, then Chriſt: bicauſe he is not acceptable vnto god for the churches ſake, but the church is acceptable vnto god for Chriſtes ſake. But to returne to the ſaying of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that God heareth not ſinners, addinge a profitable diſtinction, we maye thus expound it.<note place="margin">A diſtinction of ſinners.</note> There are ſome ſinners whiche fall of weakenes, or ſinne of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which yet afterward acknowledge themſelues, are ſory, and repent fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But there are other, which ſinne without conſcience, want fayth, neyther are they led with anye repentance. The fyrſte ſorte, bicauſe they haue fayth, are heard, the other, foraſmuch as they want fayth, do in vayne poure out theyr pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.<note place="margin">What manner of one the publi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cane was when he prayed.</note> But if a man will obiecte the Publicane, who being a ſinner, prayed vnto god and departed iuſtified. I aunſwere, that that publicane was in ſuche ſorte a ſinner, that yet when he prayed, he was not without fayth, yea rather he prayed with fayth, otherwiſe god would not haue heard his prayers. And vndoubtedly <hi>Iames</hi> doth right wel admoniſhe vs, when he ſayth: Pray, hauing faith. In ſum, that ſentence is firme and perfecte wherin it is ſayde: whatſoeuer is offred vnto God for a ſacrifice, the ſame is acceptable vnto him, if faythe and iuſtification of him that offreth, go before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A verye ſubtile cauilacion.</note>Some do cauile of the fyrſt acte of fayth, whereby we begynne fyrſt to aſſente vnto god, and they doubt, whither it be acceptable vnto god or no. Vndoubtedly before it, he is an enemy, which now beginneth to beleue. Then ſay they, if that fyrſt conſente be acceptable vnto God, then accepteth he the gifte of an enemye. But if it be not acceptable, then it iuſtifieth not. To this I aunſwer two wayes: Fyrſt that men are not iuſtified of the worthineſſe of the acte of fayth, but of the firme promiſe of god, which faith embraceth. Farther, when any man firſt aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and beleueth, then is he firſt made of an enemy a friende, and although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was an enemy, yet ſo ſone as he beleueth, he is made a friend, and ceaſeth to be an enemy.<note place="margin">Plato.</note> But that which we haue before concluded, that he which offreth is more acceptable vnto God, then the gift, the Ethnikes alſo ſawe. For <hi>Plato in Alcibiade</hi> maketh mencion, that the <hi>Athenienſes</hi> vpon a time made war againſte the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and when they were ouercome, they ſente meſſengers vnto <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> by whom they ſayd that they marueiled for what cauſe, where as they hadde offred ſo greate giftes vnto the Godes, and theyr enemies on the contrary ſide ſacrificed ſparingly and ſclenderly, and yet had they the victorye ouer them. <hi>Ammon</hi> aunſwered, that the gods more eſtemed the prayers of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> then the moſte fatte ſacrifices of the <hi>Athenienſes.</hi> For when they burnt Oxen vnto theyr Gods, in the meane time they thought nothinge of theyr ſoules. So in <hi>Homere Iupiter</hi> ſpeaketh, that the Gods are not moued with the ſmoke and ſmel of ſacrifices, when as they hated <hi>Priamus</hi> and the <hi>Troyanes.</hi> Wherfore the <hi>Ethnikes</hi> vnderſtoode, that which the Papiſts at this day ſee not, which thynke that theyr blinde ſacrificer, though he be neuer ſo vnpure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, doth yet with his hands, offer vp Chriſt vnto god the father.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee the other argument of this woman. God would neuer haue ſhewed vs theſe thinges, if he woulde haue killed vs: Foraſmuche as hee is not wont to make hys enemies of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel. Thus the wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> comforteth her fearefull huſband. But this argument ſeemeth ſomewhat obſcure, when as <hi>Balaam,</hi> althoughe he were vngodlye, was not ignorante of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles of GOD. Chryſte alſo ſayth: Manye ſhall ſaye vnto mee in that daye, haue wee not Propheſyed in thy name? To theſe thynges I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, that GOD didde not onelye foretell vnto them thynges that ſhould
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18396:214"/> come to paſſe for the deliuerye of the people, but alſo of the childe whiche they ſhould receaue, and of his education. Wherefore ſeying he vſed them as fellowe workemen, it was a certayne argument, that god had not appointed ſtrayghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to kyll them. Neyther ſpeaketh ſhe here of eternall life, but of this earthlye and corruptible life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the childe grew, and his name was called Samſon.</hi> Hereby we know that <hi>Zorah</hi> was the name of the place where <hi>Samſons</hi> fathers was borne. <hi>Samſon.</hi> This Hebrew word <hi>Shemeſch</hi> ſignifieth the ſunne, being therefore ſo called, as though he wer of the ſunne: but for what cauſe he was ſo called it is not known. I meruaile that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> interpreteth <hi>Sampſon</hi> for ſtronge or mightye,<note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſuch an Etimology agreeth not with the Hebrew word. But he oftentims goeth from the hiſtorye. And in this place alſo he ſayth that the woman prayed, when as that is not founde in the text. <hi>God bleſſed Samſon.</hi> That is, beſtowed and heaped benefites vpon hym.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſprite of God.</hi> That is the ſprite of ſtrength and mighte began to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him. <hi>In the hoſt of Dan.</hi> The hiſtory ſpeketh thus by reaſon of thoſe times. The tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> had not yet obteined poſſeſſion in the land of promes, but they wer in tents, and fought againſt theyr enemyes.<note place="margin">R.D. Kimhi.</note> 
                     <hi>R.D.

The Hebrew worde is <hi>Paam,</hi> and it ſignifieth to be moued, &amp; to be ſtriken at certayne tymes, not perpetually, but by courſes. He being a yonge man was moued, and waxed hote, to fyght the more vehemently againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And his impulſions, bycauſe they were of God, therefore are they aſcribed vnto the ſpyrite. But bicauſe wee are alreadye come vnto the ende of thys chapter, before we enter into the next, there are certayne thinges whych are to be marked.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſt, hereby we gather a moſt ſure argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with how ſinguler a care god go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerneth his church. For although the Iewes had greuouſly ſinned, yet had god a regard to theyr health, &amp; ſendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a captain, which ſhould deliuer them, &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth what things ſhould come to pas, leaſt they ſhould ſeme to haue happened by chaunce. Farther he woulde haue the childe to be a <hi>Nazarite,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Outward thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges are not to be neglected.</note> and to haue his heare to grow, and to abſtaine from wine and ſtronge drinke. Wherefore we are taught that theſe outward thinges are not vtterly vaine, but may be applied vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the glory of god. Men are wont ſometimes to ſay, when they are admoniſhed of outward thinges: What, doth god regard theſe thinges? In dede we know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that in thoſe thinges is no holineſſe to be put. Howebeit we muſte take heede that both in liuinge, and in apparell, and in going alſo in all geſture and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, we behaue our ſelues comely, both before God, and alſo before the churche, not ſuperſtitiouſly but holily, that our modeſty may aduaunce the kingdome of Chriſt and his holy Goſpel. Farthermore let vs here conſider that the wife hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the huſband with her councell. For although by the ordinarye lawe it is not lawfull for women to preach and teache in an aſſembly: yet are they not ſo deſtitute of the gratious gifts of God, but that they may inſtruct theyr huſbands with good counſels.</p>

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeemeth in many places to attribute bodies vnto Aungels,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his ſecond booke <hi>De trinitate.</hi> chap. vii. and in the third booke, chap. 1. which thing the Schoolemen perceauing, haue excuſed him, ſaying that he ſpake not according to his own opinion, but after the opinion of other men. Which thing I alſo could well allow, for as muche as I ſee that that father (in his. viii. booke <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> the .xvi. chap.) after the opinion of <hi>Apuleius, Madaurenſis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius,</hi> defineth, that Demones are in kinde <hi>animalia,</hi> that is, hauing ſenſe, in ſoule paſſiue, in mynde reaſonable, in body ayry, in time eternal. Vndoubtedly, herein he followeth the doctrine of <hi>Platoes</hi> ſect. But in the places before alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he ſemeth to ſpeake altogether of himſelfe. Yea,<note place="margin">Bernhardus.</note> and <hi>Bernhardus</hi> alſo vpon <hi>Cantica Canticorum,</hi> as it appeareth, is of the ſame opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore the ſchole men are compelled to inuent an other excuſe, and they ſay that Aungels, if they be compared with men, are ſpirites: but if with God, they haue bodies, bycauſe they fayle from the vnity and ſimplicity of God. <hi>Tertulian de carne Chriſti,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertulian.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that Aungels haue bodies. But that is not ſo much to bee marueiled of him, for he attributeth a bodye alſo vnto God him ſelfe. But he calleth a bodye whatſoeuer is. For he had to do with vnlearned and rude men, whych thynke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer is not a body, is nothing. But the ſchoolemen ſay that Aungels are in very deede ſpirites, but when they come vnto men, they take vpon them ayrye bodies, and thicken them and make them groſe, whereby they may be ſene, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and felt aboue the nature of ayre. Ther are ſome alſo which ſay, that ſome earthly or watriſhe thing is mixed with them: and yet wil they not that there is there a perfect mixture, that they ſhould not be compelled to put generacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther. There were ſome alſo, which thought that Angels ſometimes tooke vpon them dead karcaſes. But this ſeemeth vnto the greater parte a thing vnworthy, ſo to thinke of holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>Here ſome man wil ſay that it is abſurde,<note place="margin">Whither it bee conuenient for Angels to take vpon them the ſhape of man.</note> to aſcribe vnto Angels fayning &amp; lying, as to faine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be men, when as in very deede they are not men. Yea and this ſeemeth alſo to weaken the argument of Chriſt, whiche he vſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his reſurrection, to teache that he had a true body. Feele (ſaith he) and ſee, for a ſpirite hath not fleſhe and bones, as ye ſee me haue. For the Apoſtles being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde, thought that they had ſeene a ſpirite: wherfore Chriſt to put them out of doubt, bad them to handle and feele his body. But the Apoſtles might haue ſaid: That which we feele is a fanſye: it ſeemeth in deede to be Chriſt, but peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is not. For Angels alſo ſeeme to haue bodies, and to be touched and felt, when as yet in very deede they haue no bodies. Alſo this ſentence may debilitate the argument of the Fathers, as touching the fleſh of Chriſt, againſt <hi>Marcion.</hi> For he did eate (ſay they) he dranke, he was hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry, he ſlept, he did ſweate. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he had a true and humane bodye. Vnto theſe thinges might be aunſwered: that theſe ſelfe ſame thinges haue happened vnto Aungels, when as yet they had not bodyes.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: That which they firſt ſay,<note place="margin">Not whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is fayned, is a lye.</note> that it is abſurde to attribute lyes vnto Angels: they ought to conſider, that not whatſoeuer by anye meanes is fayned, is ſtraightway a lye. Chriſt appeared vnto his Diſciples as a ſtraunger, and yet he lyed not: he appeared alſo vnto <hi>Mary</hi> lyke a Gardiner, and for al that he lyed not. So Aungels, althoughe they ſemed men, when as they were not men, yet wer they not lyers. For they came not therfore, to proue them ſelues to be men, but onely that they might come to men, and talke with them.</p>
                  <p>To the argument of Chriſt touching his own body, I thus anſwer.<note place="margin">Aungels when they ſemed me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, lyed not.</note> Firſt the apoſtles thought it had ben a goſt which had appeared. And Chriſt to refel that, ſaith: feele and ſee, bicauſe a ſpirite hath not fleſh &amp; bones. By the feeling might be perceaued, that it was a true and perfect bodye which was preſent, and not a vayne fanſy. But thou wilt ſay, that it was a true body in deede, but yet taken for a tyme, and ſuche a bodye, as ſometimes Aungels are wont to put on. But
<pb facs="tcp:18396:216"/> how coulde it be taught, that that was the ſame body, which laye before in the ſepulcher? In this thing the authoritye of Chriſt and of the ſcriptures ought to be of force. For the ſcriptures teache manifeſtly inough that Chriſt ſhoulde dye, and afterwarde riſe againe the third daye:<note place="margin">Tertulian. Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nas.</note> but nothing can riſe againe, but that which before fel, as <hi>Tertulian</hi> hath moſt learnedlye written. And this thing the ſchoolemen vnderſtoode: wherefore <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſayth, that vnles certayne other thinges were added, this is no firme argument. The ſame thing maye be anſwered vnto the reaſons of the fathers againſt <hi>Marcion.</hi> Many in dede of the actions before alledged, may agree with Aungels, or with the bodies taken, but yet not all. For to be borne, to be nouriſhed, and to dye, and to feele, happen nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Angels, neither to bodies that are taken. But the ſcripture moſt apertly teſtifieth that Chriſt was both borne, and that he grew till he came to age, that he was hungry, that he dyed, and was true man. But of theſe thinges I wyll ſpeake more largely afterwarde.</p>
                  <p>There are very many other thinges in the ſchoole deuines, as touching theſe matters:<note place="margin">What maner of bodies the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels take vpon them.</note> but bicauſe they are not ſo profitable, therfore I ouerpaſſe them. But this thing I demaund, whither Angels may take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true bodies, &amp; that na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural, which bodies alſo had their being before, &amp; vſe them at their liberty, as the Deuyl did put on the Serpent, and by him deceaued <hi>Eue,</hi> the Angell alſo ſpake in the Aſſe of <hi>Bileam.</hi> Why then can not an Angel after the ſame maner, poſſeſſe an humane body, and ſpeake in it? Vndoubtedly it is written in <hi>Zachary</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet: The Angel of the Lord which ſpake in me. Wherfore it ſemeth that Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may vſe the bodies of men and beaſtes.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his .2. booke <hi>De Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate</hi> the .1. chapter, ſayth that this is a very hard queſtion, whether Angels vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to their owne proper bodies ioyne other bodies, and chaunge them into ſundrye formes, as we are woont to doo garmentes, or alſo to chaunge them into verye nature, as we reade that Chriſt chaunged water into wyne. This thing he ſaith is not impoſſible. For thus he writeth: I confeſſe it paſſeth the ſtrengthes of my capacity, whither Angels retayning ſtil the ſpiritual quality of their own body, very ſecretely woorking by it, doo take of theſe more groſe inferiour elementes, any thing which being framed vnto them they doo chaunge, as a garment, and turne it into al corporal formes or ſhapes, yea euen into the true thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as true water was turned by the Lord into wyne: or whether they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their own proper bodies into what they wyl, being framed to that which they haue in hand to doo. But whether ſoeuer of theſe it be, it pertayneth not to thys queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But I ſay, if the bodies of Angels were true bodies, then was Chriſtes argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firme, and I wil willinglier graunt to this, then to ſaye as ſome doo, that Aungels deceaued the ſenſes of men.<note place="margin">A ſubtiltye of the Papiſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiacion.</note> For after this ſorte they ſtriue agaynſt vs, when we ſay that in the Euchariſt remayneth bread, which is both ſene and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, they anſwer that it ſeemeth bread in dede, but it is not, as the Aungels ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men, when as they were no men. For I deny not, but that the ſenſes maye ſometimes be deceaued.<note place="margin">A diſtinction of ſenſible things. When the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes maye be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, &amp; when not.</note> But I affirme in the meane time, that there are twoo kindes of thoſe thinges, which are perceaued by ſenſe. For there ar ſome things common vnto many ſenſes, and other are proper to ſome one ſenſe. For figure, magnitude, and number, are perceaued of manye ſenſes. And vndoubtedlye in ſuch thinges the ſenſe may ſometimes be deceaued, as <hi>Carneades</hi> was woont to diſpute of an ore in the water appearing broken, and of the bygnes of the bodye of the Sunne. But in ſenſible things proper vnto one ſenſe, the ſenſe is neuer deceaued, vnles there be ſome fault in the body, or ouer much diſtaunce, or ſome ſuche lyke let. Wherfore ſeyng in the Euchariſt the ſenſe iudgeth that the bread remayneth, there is no neede to fayne that the ſenſe is therein deceaued.</p>
                  <p>But to appoynt a certayne compendious way of this diſputacion, there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> three maner of wayes, whereby Angels may ſeme to haue appeared. For either
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18396:216"/> they were ſene in fantaſy, ſo that they were thought to haue bodies, when they had them not. Which reaſon cannot be firme, for they illuded not the ſenſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther were they ſene of any one onely, but very often times of many, &amp; they were ſo ſene, that <hi>Abraham</hi> waſhed their feete, and <hi>Iacob</hi> wraſtled with an Angel the whole night. Or els they appeared with a true body in dede, which yet was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſuch a body, as it was thought to be.

                     <hi>Apelles</hi> the heretike, being in maner ouercome with theſe reaſons, graunteth that Chriſt had in dede true fleſh, but he denieth that he was borne, but brought from heauen: and he obiecteth that the bodies, which were taken by Angels, wer true bodies, but they were not borne. Suche a body (ſayth he) had Chriſt. <hi>Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> anſwereth hereunto: They, ſayth he, which ſet foorth the fleſhe of Chriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of the Aungels, ſaying that it was not borne, namelye a fleſhye ſubſtaunce, I would haue them to compare the cauſes alſo, as well of Chriſt as of the Aungels, for which they came into the fleſh. No Aungel did at anye tyme therefore diſcende to be crucified, to ſuffer death, and to riſe againe from death. If there was neuer any ſuch cauſe why angels ſhould be incorporate, then haſte thou a cauſe why they tooke fleſh, and yet wer not borne. They came not to die, therefore they came not to bee borne. But Chriſte beyng ſent to dye, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye that he ſhoulde bee borne, that he might dye: for none is woont to dye, but hee whiche is borne. He addeth moreouer: And euen then alſo the Lorde himſelfe appeared among thoſe angels vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> without birth, namelye with fleſh, for the ſame diuerſity of cauſe. Afterward he addeth: That the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels haue their bodies rather from earth, then from heauen. Let them proue ſaith he, that thoſe angels receaued the ſubſtance of fleſh of the ſtars. If they proue it not, bicauſe it is not written, then was not the fleſh of Chriſt thereof, to whych Chriſt they apply the example of Angels. And in his third booke againſt <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> My God, ſaith he, which hath reformed it, taken of the ſlyme in this quality, not yet of ſeede by mariage, and yet fleſh, might as wel of anye matter haue framed fleſh alſo vnto Angels, which alſo framed the world of nothing, into ſo manye and ſuche bodies. Againe in his booke <hi>de carne Chriſti,</hi> hee ſaith: It is manifeſt that angels cary not fleſh proper of their own, as ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces by nature ſpiritual, and if they haue any body, yet it is of their owne kinde, and are tranſfigurable for a time into the fleſh of man, that they may be ſene, and haue fellowſhip with men. Farther, in his third booke againſt <hi>Marcion:</hi> Know thou ſaith he, that this is not graunted vnto thee, that the fleſh in Angels was putatiue, or by imagina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion, but of the very and ſound ſubſtance of man. For if it were not hard to geue vnto that putatiue fleſh the true ſenſes and actes of fleſh, much more eaſyer was it to geue a true ſubſtance of fleſh, to true ſenſes and actes, euen for that he is the proper authour and woorker therof. For it is a harder thyng for God to make a lye, then to fayne a body. Laſt of al, thus he concludeth: Therfore are they truly humayne bodies, bicauſe of the truth of God, who is far from lying and deceate.

                  <p>I could rehearſe mo thinges out of <hi>Tertulian,</hi> but theſe ſeeme ſufficient for this preſent purpoſe. In ſumme, he thinketh that Aungels haue bodies, but yet ſtraunge bodies, and not their own. For their proper bodies (as he thinketh) per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine vnto the ſpirituall kinde. Secondlye, he ſayth that thoſe ſtraunge bodies which they take, are created either of nothing, or els of ſome matter which ſhall ſeme good vnto God. Thirdly he affirmeth that they were true, perfect, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies, and not vayne or fayned, but of a true fleſh, and not of a fleſh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearing, ſo that of men they might be both touched and handled, to the end he might both remoue diſſimulation from God, and alſo confirme the veritye of humane fleſh in Chriſt. Wherby is concluded, that the humane ſenſes wer not

An other errour is of thoſe which thinke that the perfecte and true bodyes ſhall ryſe agayne with fleſhe, ſynewes, and bones, whych thing (as hee ſaythe) is not poſſible: bycauſe fleſhe and bloode ſhall not poſſeſſe the kyngdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But <hi>Origene</hi> ought to haue conſidered what followeth afterward in <hi>Paul.</hi> For he addeth: Neyther ſhall corruption poſſeſſe incorruption.

But <hi>Origene</hi> to retayne that hys meaning, confeſſed that the bodyes ſhoulde ryſe in deede, but not thycke and with bones, but ſpirituall, as <hi>Paule</hi> hath ſayde: The body ſhall ryſe ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Origene</hi> in thoſe woordes marketh not that <hi>Paule</hi> calleth it a ſpiritual bodye, not bicauſe it ſhoulde vtterlye bee chaunged into a ſpirite, but bycauſe it ſhould haue ſpiritual condicions, namely incorruption, and moſt cleare bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But bycauſe he perceaued that the body of Chriſt, which after his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he offered vnto hys Diſciples to be touched and to be felt, was againſt hys doctrine, therefore he ſayth: Let not the bodye of Chriſte deceaue you, bycauſe it had manye ſynguler priuiledges, whiche are not graunted vnto other bodyes. Farther, that by this diſpenſacion he might prooue that he verelye was ryſen, he would after hys reſurrection haue a true bodye, not that other bodies in the reſurrection ſhoulde be lyke. But he ſhewed the nature of his ſpirituall body in <hi>Emaus,</hi> when he vaniſhed awaye from the ſight of hys Diſciples.

Whereby it came to paſſe, that he ſhoulde trulye bee borne, that hee ſhould dye, and redeeme mankinde. Wherefore he dyd truely call hym ſelfe the ſonne of man: and in <hi>Iohn</hi> he ſayth, ye ſeeke to kyl me, a man, whiche haue tolde you the truth.

For vnleſſe Chriſte had bene true man, a Virgin coulde not haue conceiued him, neither haue brought him foorth, nor called him her ſonne. This thing <hi>Tertulian</hi> prudently marked. If he had bene a ſtraunger, ſayth he,<note place="margin">Tertulian.</note> a Virgin coulde not either haue conceaued him, or borne him. The Aungell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaluted <hi>Mary</hi> after this maner: Be not afraid ſayd he, thou ſhalt conceaue. &amp;c. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſayd: How happeneth this to me, that the mother of my Lorde ſhoulde come vnto me?

And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> wee reade: Of whom is Chriſte according vnto the fleſhe. All theſe thynges prooue moſt apeartly, that Chriſt was true man, and in hym was one ſubſtaunce of God and man. Theſe thinges cannot be ſayd of the Aungels, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Sonne of God, before he was borne of the Virgin: although whyleſt he appeared, he had true fleſhe (as we haue before ſayde:) but yet not ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym in one and the ſelfe ſame ſubſtaunce: neither could it be ſayde of the holy ghoſt, that he was in very deede a Dooue, althoughe that wherein he once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, was a true Dooue.

And in the booke of Numbers the .30. chapter, if a mayden vowe a vowe, and the father heare it, and letteth it not, the vowe ſhalbe firme: but if he gainſay it, it ſhalbe in vain. But what is a vow?

Wherefore they breake the lawe of God, which obey not the parents alſo in this thing. Farther, if they will haue the liberty of contracting of matrimony to be ſo great, why doo they themſelues prohibite ſo many degrees of mariages, whiche God neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited? Once the Popes would not ſuffer matrimony to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the ſeuenth degree, but now they contayne within the fourth: moreouer why do they forbid mariages vnto the miniſters of the Churche? Farther, why did God himſelf forbid matrimonies betwene perſons of contrary religion, if in mariage there ought to be ſo great a liberty as they fayne to be? But they adde: Children for feare of their parentes will ſaye that that matrimony pleaſeth them, whiche pleaſeth them not. But the ſonne is not compelled ſo to ſay: nothyng letteth but that he may anſwere, that that wife pleaſeth him not, and that ſuch a matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he can not abyde. And in deede without his conſent matrimony can be by no meanes contracted.

For what greater neceſſity can there bee, then that whiche the lawe and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God bryng with them? Children are commaunded to honour father and mother. Alſo <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle preſcribeth them to obey their parentes in all thinges. And the ſame thyng writeth he vnto the <hi>Phillipians</hi> the .4. chapter. That whiche remayneth brethren: What ſoeuer thynges are true, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are honeſt, whatſoeuer iuſte, whatſoeuer pure, whatſoeuer profitable, whatſoeuer lucky, theſe thinges do ye. &amp;c. By theſe woordes appeareth that the thynges whiche are honeſt, muſte not bee ſeparated from the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God. Wherefore looke howe neceſſary it is to obey the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of God, ſo neceſſary is it not to mary without the conſent of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.

It were muche better not to deſire it, then to deſire it with that mynde.

I aunſwere, when ſuch mariages were had in thoſe darkenes before the new light of the Goſpell, thoſe men were not in dede excuſed from ſynne (for it was not lawfull for them to be ignoraunt of the law of God) but yet bycauſe they were done publikely, &amp; the Magiſtrate permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, I am perſuaded that ſuch contractes are firme and ratified.

But now the truth of the thyng beyng knowen, the Magiſtrates ought to reuoke the errour. Wherfore the matrimonyes whiche haue bene hitherto, that is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes contracted agaynſt the will of the parentes, ought to bee firme, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren borne of them ought to be counted legitimate. But if the lawe ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde bee reuoked, then ſhould they not be matrimonyes, but onely be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but in very deede fornications, whoredomes, and aduoutryes, as <hi>Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtus</hi> ryghtly iudgeth.

                     <note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note>Some of the fathers ſeme to abhorre from all kynde of playes. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his 1. booke <hi>de officiis,</hi> chapter .23. Playes (ſayth he,) and paſtymes ſeme ſweete and and pleaſaunt, when as yet they are contrary to the rule of a Chriſtian. For it is not founde in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> howe they ought to be vſed. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Mathewe</hi> the .6.

For when they had worſhipped the calfe and incurred ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrye, they ſeemed to haue obtayned thys rewarde of the deuill, namely to play. Peraduenture <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> alludeth to that which <hi>Plato</hi> wrote in <hi>Phedro,</hi> that <hi>Theut</hi> the demon of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> found out <hi>Numbers, Geometry, Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſtine</note> letters, and dyſe. But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in hys .2. booke <hi>de Muſica,</hi> ſayeth that it is a parte of a wyſeman to reuoke the mynde from earneſt matters: and that is chiefely done by playe. Wherefore it ſemeth to be lawfull. But howe ſo great
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18396:225"/> an oblectation ryſeth of playe, it is not heard to vnderſtande. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in hys .2.<note place="margin">Ariſtotle,</note> booke of Rhethoriques putteth victory or hope of victorye among the cauſes of oblectation. But when we playe, either we obtayne the victory, or elles we are in ſome hope thereof. Wherefore they whiche defend playe,<note place="margin">Play is a cauſe of defectation.</note> doo determine with themſelues, that the mynde ought ſometymes to bee no les refreſhed, then the body: and as the body is renewed by reſt or quietnes,<note place="margin">Why play ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.</note> ſo they ſay the mynde is recreated by playe. By whiche meanes they thinke to proue that there muſte ſome place bee lefte for playes: addyng yet certayne cautions. Firſte, that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be no filthy and vnhoneſt woordes vſed in playes.<note place="margin">Cautio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be added vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt player.</note> It is not ſeldome ſene that in playing both filthy and alſo blaſphemous wordes do happen. We muſt alſo take hede, that there be not vſed to muche lyghtnes, and diſſolution of grauity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and comelynes. For oftentymes it commeth to paſſe, that men do ſo vtterly geue themſelues to playe, that afterward, they are able to do nothyng grauely. Farther, the circumſtances are diligently to be marked, of the perſon (I ſay) the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> place, and the tyme. It is certayn in deede that in the holy ſcriptures there is no rule or forme preſcribed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning playes,<note place="margin">The lawe of god entreateth nothynge of playes.</note> although in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are read many kinds of playes. In <hi>Geneſis</hi> the aungell wraſtled the whole night with <hi>Iacob. Sara</hi> ſaw <hi>Iſaac</hi> play with <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> which ſhe tooke in euill parte, not vndoubtedly bycauſe he played, but bycauſe he played together with the ſonne of a bondewoman. <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo daunced &amp; played before the arke of the Lord. And the maydens ſang in their daunces, <hi>Saull</hi> hath ouercome in his thouſandes, &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi> in his .x. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes. And Chriſt complayned that the Iewes were like vnto children playing in the ſtreetes and ſaying: We haue ſonge vnto you, &amp;c. And although of theſe thynges there be no certayne rules manifeſtly wrytten in the holy Scriptures, yet are they ſet foorth in the ciuill lawes.</p>
                  <p>But before I ſpeake of them, it ſhalbe good,<note place="margin">A diſtinction of playes.</note> to diſtribute playes into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and kindes. There are ſome which are vtterly referred vnto chaunce, as he whiche caſteth moſt, or caſteth thys chaunce or that, carieth awaye the rewarde. There are other whereby the powers either of the body or minde are excerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Such playes as depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chaunce &amp; are vnderſtand by the name of diſeplay,<note place="margin">Of dyſeplaye.

By theſe things it appeareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ciuill lawe to playe at dyſe was a thyng very odious. <hi>Cicero</hi> in .2. <hi>Phillip.</hi> agaynſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius:</hi> His houſe (ſayth he) is full of dyſeplayers and dronkardes.

Howbeit it is permitted vnto them of the houſehold to play among themſelues, for that whiche may afterward be eaten in a feaſt. But in the <hi>Code de religioſis ſumptibus funeru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> it is more ſeuerely ordeyned of play, dyſe, &amp; dyſeplayers.

Wherefore he decreed, that it ſhould not be lawfull for any man to play, nor to loke vpon hym that playeth: &amp; he admoniſheth the Biſhops, diligently to loke that theſe things be obſerued. The ſame <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperor in his Authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiques, in the title <hi>de ſacroſanctis Epiſcopis,</hi> in the paragraphe <hi>Interdicimus</hi> doth prohibite by name, that no Biſhoppe, Prieſt, or Deacon, ſhould either playe themſelues, or looke vpon them that playe.

But they ought to vnderſtande, that it is the dewty of the Magiſtrate, to ſee that euery man vſe hys owne thinges well. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider more deepely that God gaue vnto theſe money, wherewith they might haue to nooriſhe their family, and to helpe the poore, and not to caſte them to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and put them to the ſlippernes of Fortune. Farther it behoueth and eſpecially Chriſtians to repreſent the image of God: who gouerneth and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all thynges with reaſon. But ſo to conſume money, is not to be a Lord ouer his own things, but a tyranne. This alſo mayſt thou adde hereunto, if any thing be gotten by this meanes, the ſame both is, and alſo is called, filthy gayne.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Whether thinges loſt by dyſeplaye may be recouered.</note>But for as muche as it is counted filthy gayne it may iuſtly be demaunded, whether thoſe thynges whiche be loſt by dyſeplaye, may iuſtly be demaunded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. I aunſwere, that if he whiche loſeth be not in his owne power, but vnder an other man, as are the children of the houſeholde and ſeruauntes, the lawes do geue recouery, and that euen to .50. yeares. But if they be their owne men, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery is not graunted, &amp; the cauſe is aſſigned, bycauſe filthines is on either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In whiche caſe the cauſe of the poſſeſſor is the better. In the digeſtes. In the title <hi>de condictione ob turpem cauſam</hi> in the lawe <hi>vbi autem,</hi> when filthynes is in either party, there is no iudgement geuen. What then ſhalbe done with the money? They ſay it muſt be beſtowed vpon the poore, ſo that he which hath loſt, may haue hurte, and he which hath gayned, ſhall not haue the fruition of thyngs euill gotten. This is to be done when the poſſeſſion is tranſferred. Of the ſame mynde was <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle .54.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> to <hi>Macedonius.</hi> Where the poſſeſſion (ſayeth he) is tranſferred, let the money bee geuen vnto the poore. But where it is not tranſferred, as if a man take awaye any thyng by thefte, and loſe it at diſe, let it be reſtored. Wherfore we muſt decree, that ſuch playes ought not to be ſuffred whiche are gouerned by chaunce and raſhenes, ſo that in them, goods and money are endaungered: bycauſe it longeth to the publique wealth, to ſee that thynges be ryghtly gouerned: and God geueth goodes, to be ſpent to good vſes. And bycauſe by it ſpryng oftentymes horrible blaſphemies, and robbyng of our friendes, and couetous deſire of other mens goodes is ſtirred vp, beſides the greate loſſe of tyme. Theſe thynges both the ciuill lawes and alſo the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall do ſee: but at thys day they are not regarded. For the Canonicall lawes are contemned of the Clergy, and the ciuill lawes are deſpiſed of the Princes. For there is no where eyther more often or more filthily playe vſed, then among princes, and Eccleſiaſtical men: whiche in deede were of good iudgement, when they wrote thoſe lawes: but they haue lyued and alſo do lyue moſt filthily.</p>

                  <p>Farther, there is a certaine other maner of playing,<note place="margin">Tables.</note> which leaneth partly to chaunce, and partly to induſtry, as is playing at Tables, and ſuche lyke, where in deede they caſt by chaunce, but the caſtes are gouerned by induſtry,<note place="margin">Plato.</note> wherfore <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed that the life of men, is like vnto the play at Tables.

But the reaſon which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> firſt alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged was, bicauſe there is nothing found in the holy ſcriptures how theſe things ought to be vſed. To that we wil anſwer, that they are found in the holye ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures generallye: whither ye eate, or whither ye drinke, or whither ye doo anye thing els, doo al thinges to the glory of God. Wherfore the body and the minde are ſo ſometimes to be refreſhed with plaies, that we may afterward be prompt to grauer matters. Farther, there is nothing found peculiarly in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures touching Bakers, Cookes, nor Shipmen, and yet neuertheles their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes are not vtterly to be excluded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaid that the Deuil found out play, and alledged this:<note place="margin">Chriſoſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſat downe to eate and to drinke, &amp; they roſe vp to play. If a man looke more narowly vpon that place of this father, hee ſhall ſee that hee ſpake of thoſe men which would not repent, but were woont to ſay: I woulde to God I might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer weepe, but might alwaies play and laugh. To whom, he ſayth, Chriſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: Bleſſed are they which mourne. And foraſmuche as we ſo often ſinne, and doo ſo grieuouſly offend God, how ſhould we haue leaſure to play? He alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth thoſe playes whereby we are made ſluggiſh &amp; vnapt to good workes. We doo not in play and laughing (ſayth he) imitate Chriſte or the Apoſtles: for we neuer reade that they either played or laughed. How beit he addeth a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for as muche as he addeth, I doo not vniuerſaly take away al laughter, but the exceſſiue and immoderate laughter. Laſtly he turneth him ſelfe to ſtage
<pb facs="tcp:18396:227"/> playes, and ſaith that they were inuented by the Deuill: for they containe the wicked actes and whooredomes of the Gods, whereby the conſciences of godly men are greuouſly wounded, and wicked luſtes are many waies ſtirred vp. And in that he ſaith that theſe thinges were inuented by the Deuil, he ſpeaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the truth: bicauſe (as I haue admoniſhed) they were inſtituted in the honour of falſe Gods. Yea and this thing he addeth alſo, that the Deuyll builded ſtages in Cities.</p>
                  <p>But nowe to conclude, me thinketh that thoſe kindes of playes which ſerue to renewe ſtrengthes in men, are not vtterly to be forbidden. Neither ought we lightly to be offended, if we ſe a man play at Cheſſe, with which play the powers of the body are nothing holpen, but onelye the induſtrye of the minde exerciſed. For if through age ſtrength faile, ſo that they cannot exerciſe them ſelues by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other meanes, or that their body be but weake, why ſhoulde they not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, moderately to delight them ſelues with this kinde of play? Neither alſo is he ſtraightway to be condemned, which being ſicke or weake recreateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with that kynde of playe, which dependeth of Fortune or chaunce, ſo that there in be no daunger of loſſe of money.<note place="margin">To what ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the lawes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned or pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hibited playes.</note> For we muſt chieflye regarde to what entent the lawes forbad that. It was vndoubtedly that a man ſhould not waſte his goods prodigally, and therfore it was prouided by the law that a man ſhould not haſard aboue a ſhilling: as it is had in the Code, in the place before alledged. This was the meaning of the law, that money ſhould not be yll conſumed.</p>
                  <p>But ſome ſay they delight not in play, except they play for money. But I wil demaund of them to what vſe they entend to beſtow that mony? Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they wil ſay vpon a feaſt. Why not rather vpon the poore? But I ſaye it is much better and ſafer not to play for any money. For although it maye bee that thou thy ſelfe art not touched with couetouſnes, the other yet with whom thou playeſt, is peraduenture touched: Let the occaſions vnto euyll be taken awaye, which otherwiſe are very manye which moue vnto euyll. And if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els to feare vs away from playes, let vs for Gods ſake wayghe this, howe greate the penury of time is. The law of God requireth ſo manye duties, that not our whole lyfe is able to performe them: and yet ſhall wee beſtowe time in playes? We are otherwiſe ſufficientlye ſicke with couetouſnes of money, wyth ambicion to ouercome and excell other: why do we ſtyrre vp theſe diſeaſes with playes? But thou wilt ſay: Theſe thinges are neuer ſtirred vp in me. But now thou muſt remember that they maye eaſelye be ſtirred vp. And we muſt ſee not onely to our ſelues, but that we bring not other alſo vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame diſeaſe. Theſe thinges are ſpoken of the honeſt kindes of playes. If ſo be there be anye whyche doo play, being entiſed with couetouſnes, let thoſe men knowe that they rather like euil marchauntes trafficke,<note place="margin">Male mercari</note> then playe. For they ſeeke no other thing but filthy gaine. Neither ſeeke they pleaſure, which in honeſt playes is the chiefeſt, but they ſeeke their owne thinges, and that by filthye meanes. And when they which delight immoderatly in playes, doo ſay: There muſt be ſome pleaſure in the life, whereby we maye be recreated: Their requeſt is to be graunted, but in the meane time they muſt bee admoniſhed, that there are other pleaſures more honeſt. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the .v. chap. ſaith: Speake vnto your ſelues in Pſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes,<note place="margin">Tertulian.</note> Himnes, and ſpiritual ſonges, ſinging and making mery in your hartes. And the ſame thing writeth he vnto the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> the third chap. <hi>Tertulian</hi> in <hi>Apologetico</hi> ſayth that Chriſtians vſed to aſſemble together to their moderate ſhorte ſuppers, and when they wer refreſhed with meate, they ſang deuine prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or recited ſomthing out of the holye ſcriptures, prouoking one an other by them. And by this meanes they returned ſober home.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Other honeſt pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides playes.</note>There are alſo problemes, wherwith the wits may be exerciſed and refreſhed: which problemes if they ſeme to hard, there are hiſtories, which may wyth leſſer labour be learned. Why are not men hyred to reade them vnto them? There is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18396:227"/> no hiſtory ſo ſclender, which is not very much profitable for ſome part of mans life. There are alſo hiſtories of plants, of herbes, and of ſtones. There are lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe communications of godlye men one with an other, which are ſweete and pleaſant, wherewith mindes are refreſhed, and therewithal edefied. I do not (as I haue ſaid) vtterly take away playes: but I prefer theſe thinges, as much more honeſt and profitable. But now let vs returne vnto the play of <hi>Samſon,</hi> whych though it was honeſt and liberal, yet had it a deadly ende. And if this playe had ſuch yl ſucceſſe, what is to be hoped of thoſe which are prohibited by the lawes?

                  <p>The young men come vnto <hi>Samſons</hi> wife, deſire her to intreate her huſband, and by al meanes to enquire of him what his propoſicion ſignified. They adde moreouer threatninges, and thoſe horrible, namely that otherwiſe they would burne her and her fathers houſe. This is the nature of peruers men, when they can not ouercome by ſtrength and induſtry, they flee to deceites. This maye be ſene in theſe young men: rather then they would ſuffer them ſelues to be conque<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red or ouercome, they go about fraude and ſnares. But chiefly they go vnto hys wife, that (both bicauſe ſhe was a woman, which might eaſelye be wonne, &amp; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was deare &amp; welbeloued of her huſband) they myght vſe her labour to wreſt and wring out the ſecrete of her huſbande. They make her therefore the betrayer, and that which is moſt grieuous, of her own huſband. This is often
<pb facs="tcp:18396:228"/> times the ende of playes. The thing for which they contended, was of no great value. For euery one of them were in daunger onely of the loſſe of one garment and ſheete a peece: &amp; yet they ſay: <hi>Haſt thou called vs, that he ſhould poſſeſſe vs?</hi> As though they ſhould loſe al that euer they had. Theſe thinges rightlye agree with thoſe which do play to that end, to depriue other men of their goods. They which haue loſt, may after this maner complain of the winner: Thou haſt with this pretence prouoked me to plai, to rob me, &amp; not to take any pleaſure by play. The woman in the meane time (as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) wept, and complained vnto her huſband,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> that he loued her not, neither eſteemed her. <hi>Thou hateſt me</hi> (ſayth ſhe) <hi>for as much as thou wylt not declare vnto me thy ſecretes.</hi> But <hi>Samſon</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth wiſely. <hi>Yea, but I haue not ſhewed it vnto my pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and thinkeſt thou that I loue them not?</hi> What cauſe is there that thou ſhouldeſt complaine?

                     </note> And ſeing ther are many euil and babling women, which blab out thinges of great importance, to their huſbandes great dammage, therefore wiſe men commit not many thinges to their wiues ſecrete keeping: for ther are many thinges that are not expedient for them to know. And babling is a vyce in a maner proper vnto women. <hi>Plutarche</hi> telleth of this thing an elegant hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Papirius Pretextatus,</hi> which nowe is ſufficient onelye to ſhewe. Many, though they be ſtrong in body, and excel in ſtrength, yet are they weake in hart. <hi>Samſon</hi> had ouercome a Lyon, but yet at the laſt hee coulde not ouercome the teares of hys wyfe. As long as his wife ſhewed her ſelfe ſad and heauye vnto him, <hi>Samſon</hi> could not beare it. The holye ghoſt woulde haue theſe thinges ſet foorth in the holy ſcriptures, whereby we might ſee the nature and corrupcion of our fleſhe.</p>

                     </note> All they of the Eaſt did meaſure the ende of the day by the going downe of the ſunne, which by thys place we may gather, and by many other.

Ambroſe</hi> ſayth that <hi>Samſon,</hi> when hee heard theſe thinges, ſtrayghtwaye added: what is more vnfaythfull then a woman? This aſſuredlye which is added in the text, is not much vnlike: <hi>Except ye had plowed wyth my Heyfer.</hi> To plowe is to dyg, to turne, and to ſearche the earth. So they ſearched out the mayden, that by her they might come to the counſell of her huſbande. This vndoubtedlye is an eaſye interpretacion.<note place="margin">Leui ben Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon.</note> For that is not ſufficient whych <hi>Leui ben Gerſon</hi> bringeth, that thoſe young men committed aduoutry with the mayden, and by that abuſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode the ryddle of <hi>Samſon.</hi> For if this thing had happened, <hi>Samſon</hi> woulde not haue retayned her in matrimony.</p>
                  <p>When they had abſolued the riddle, nothing remained but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Samſon</hi> ſhould pay vnto them the wager. And that price would he pay vnto the Philiſtines, of the goods and riches of other Philiſtines. The miſerable woman feared, that if ſhe had not ſhewed vnto the young men the ſecrete of her huſband, ſhe ſhould with all her famely haue bene burnt. But by thys meanes ſhe did in very deede get vnto her ſelfe burning. For as wee ſhall heare, when <hi>Samſon</hi> had inferred grieuous euyls vnto the Philiſtianes, they not ſuffring the iniuries, aſſembled a power, and burnt the houſe of hys wyues father. So the mayden fell into the pyt which ſhe had made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And hys wrath was kyndled,</hi> namelye againſt his wyfe. But why did <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> require ſecretnes of her, which he himſelf could not keepe? He ought to haue kept ſcilence, and not haue reuealed vnto her the ſecrete, if he woulde haue had hys ſecretes kept cloſe. Farther, as touching the murther of the Philiſtians, yf we thynke of <hi>Samſon,</hi> as of ſome priuate man, hee can by no meanes be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For it is lawfull for no priuate manne to ſpoyle and kyll others, to paye hys owne debtes wythall. But bycauſe (as the hyſtorye teacheth) he was
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18396:228"/> ſtirred vp to doo this by the impulſion of the holy ghoſt, therfore ought he not to be accuſed. For it is written: <hi>And when the ſpirite of the Lord came vpon hym, he went downe to Aſcalon. &amp;c.</hi> Therefore we wil not reproue <hi>Samſon,</hi> but yet we wil not draw his act into an example. But this let vs imitate, to ſuffer our ſelues to be the inſtrumentes of the ſpirite of God, &amp; let vs with a valiaunt and bold minde follow him being our guide. For although <hi>Samſon</hi> ſhould fyght at one time againſt .xxx. men, yet bicauſe he was driuen by the ſpirite of God, hee was nothing afearde. <hi>He tooke away the ſpoyles. Celiphoth,</hi> that is, their vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt &amp; chaungeable garmentes, which he had taken away from them which he had ſlaine. But ther is mencion made that he payd onely <hi>Celiphoth:</hi> neither is there any thing ſpoken of the linnen ſheetes, which yet ought by the bargain to be payde. The Hebrues thinke that here is vſed the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> that by part is vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the whole. <hi>Dauid Kimhi</hi> ſaith, he would not pay the whole, bicauſe they came to the knowledge of the riddle by euil artes, but yet that they ſhould not altogether complaine of his faith, he gaue them part.</p>
                  <p>There ariſeth a doubt, bicauſe <hi>Samſon</hi> was a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> &amp; by his profeſſion it was not lawful for him to drinke wine, nor to cut his heare,<note place="margin">How it was lawful for Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon to handle dead Carkaſes being a Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</note> nor to touche any dead corps. But he muſt nedes touch their bodies, whom when he had ſlaine he ſtripped out of their clothes. Ther are diuers &amp; ſundry anſwers brought. Some ſay he was a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> but not as touching this third condicion. For the Angell onelye admoniſhed his Parentes that he ſhoulde drinke no wyne, nor pole hys head: but commaunded nothing for touching of dead bodies. But other ſay that he did in deede kil the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> but yet he ſtripped of their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, while they were yet breathing and on lyue. And there are ſome which thinke that hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that one or twoo of them which wer left a lyue, ſhould ſtrippe the other, and ſhould go free for their labour. But theſe ſeeme mere faininges. The difficultye may be diſpatched by one woord: a <hi>Nazarite</hi> was bound by religion, not of hys owne accorde to touche dead bodies. But this man was moued by the ſpirite of God: neither did he theſe thinges of his own wyl. Wherefore the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the religion of a <hi>Nazarite</hi> ought in this ſteede to geue place vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt. I am not ignorant how men doo eaſely maruaile, that the holye ghoſt would mingle it ſelfe with playes and trifles of yong men. For that can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeme to be agreable vnto the maieſty of God. Let humane reaſon meruayle at theſe thinges, as much as it liſt:<note place="margin">The prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God vſeth things, though they bee neuer ſo lyght.</note> yet is it nothing contrary vnto the maieſtye of God, if it mingle it ſelf with thinges neuer ſo light. For hereby the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God appeareth more bright, when men vnderſtande that it alſo conuerteth thinges moſt baſe and moſt light, vnto the glory of the name of God. For, for a man with apt and meete inſtruments, to bring any thing to paſſe, it is no great matter: but with thinges vnapt and deformed, to fabricate any excellent thyng, this ſeemeth to pertaine to a cunning woorkeman. Theſe thinges ſeme in deede to be light, but what is more light then dreames? whiche yet God vſeth to the glory of his name, as the hiſtory of <hi>Pharao</hi> and <hi>Nabuchad-Nezar</hi> doo manifeſtly declare. But what doo I ſpeake of Kinges? God would by dreames exalt <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being a priſoner and poore man, vnto a kingdome. So woulde he haue the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce of <hi>Eſau</hi> turned vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi> in a maner by a play. And by fraud the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was wreſted by <hi>Iacob</hi> from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> couering his handes &amp; necke with Goates ſkyns. Yea and alſo the ſpirit of God mingleth it ſelf ſomtimes with the plaies and verſes of Poetes, when as they (how ſoeuer they ſeeme to play) do yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times write true, profitable and graue thinges. And that thoſe thinges are of God, no man ought to doubt. Let this be had for certaine, that all thynges doo obey vnto God, dreames, playes, light thinges, graue thinges, and noble. He is the ruler and gouernour of al thinges, wherefore no man ought to bee offended when hee heareth theſe thinges. God ſeemeth more and more to increaſe the ſtrength of <hi>Samſon,</hi> for before being vnarmed, he fought with a Lyon: which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
<pb facs="tcp:18396:229"/> was a great thing. But this is much greater, to fight at one time wyth xxx. men. God would ſo exerciſe him, that he ſhould geue ouer him ſelfe wholye to the counſell of the ſpirite.</p>

For when he was gone, the father gaue his daughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an other huſband, namely to the fellow of <hi>Samſon,</hi> and paranimphe, whyche had ioyned himſelfe a companion vnto him in the mariage. The mayden ſawe ſhe had grieuouſly offended her huſband, wherfore ſhe fearing his fiercenes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth her father to prouide her an other huſband: For it is not credible (as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaith) that theſe thinges were done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the good wil of the maiden.<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> But diuorſement ſhould not be made ſo raſhly, and for ſo light a cauſe. Chriſte hath made one cauſe onely of diuorcement, namely aduoutry. <hi>Paul</hi> addeth the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of religion: although he wyll not haue the faithfull to depart, if the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing party wil dwel together. Neither permitted he ſecond mariages, bicauſe man and wife agree not in religion, but bicauſe the one wil not abide wyth the other.<note place="margin">Ther was here no cauſe of iuſt diuorcement.</note> In <hi>Samſons</hi> cauſe there is neither of theſe. There was no aduoutrye, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the mayden ſay ſhe would not dwell with her huſband: neither did <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> repudiate his wife, although he then departed from her. For afterwarde he returned vnto her, as we ſhal heare. And although he ſo departed, that the wyfe knewe not where he was become, yet ought ſhe not ſtraight way to marye an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the ciuill lawes, when any ſuche thing happeneth, doo appoynt her to tary fyue yeares, as it is had in the Digeſtes <hi>De diuortiis,</hi> in the law <hi>Vxor.</hi> And in the Authentikes <hi>De Nuptiis,</hi> in the Paragraphe <hi>Sed etiam.</hi> The Canon lawes in the Decretals would haue amended theſe thinges, and decreed that it ſhould not bee lawfull to marye againe before ſome certaine woorde were broughte of the death of the firſt huſbande or wyfe. But with what godlynes and wyſdome they did that, I wyll not at this tyme declare.</p>
                  <p>It is certaine that in this place was iniuſtice done for the wife to mary an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being not ignoraunt that her huſbande was yet on lyue. But the Father excuſeth the act, ſaying: I thought thou haddeſt hated my daughter. But why ſhould he haue ſuffered hymſelfe to be perſwaded after this ſorte? It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that he ſhoulde before haue knowen <hi>Samſons</hi> mynde,<note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> and taryed for a booke of deuorcement. Although I ſee that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> is of this opinion, that hee thinketh <hi>Samſon</hi> dyd repudiate his wyfe. But that is not very lykely, when as he afterwarde deſcended, to take his wife againe vnto him. Neyther ſhould the Philiſtians iuſtly haue burned that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his famely.<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> Yea and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo denyeth that there was any deuorcement. This is in a maner the fruite of thoſe that are ioyned together in an vnequall mariage. We reade the lyke thing in the fyrſt booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the .xxv. chapter. <hi>Dauid</hi> had maryed <hi>Michol</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Saul:</hi> and when <hi>Dauid</hi> fled, her Father gaue her vnto an other huſbande, when as the firſt huſbande had not yet repudiated her, but afterwarde <hi>Dauid</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded her agayne. In the meane tyme let vs that are Chriſtians, determine thys with our ſelues, that it is not lawfull to diſſolue matrimonies for lyghte cauſes. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaythe: If the wooman depart, let her remayne vnmaryed, or let her be reconciled vnto her huſbande.<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> Which aſſuredlye hee ment not of aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: for he woulde not amende the woordes of Chriſt, but as <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, he vnderſtoode theſe thynges of lyghter offences, for as muche as of them ſome reconſiliacion may be hoped for: whych is vtterly cut of, if ſhe be maryed to an other.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Salamon</hi> in hys Canticles ſayth: Take Foxes for vs which deſtroye the vyneyardes. Wherefore there was ſo great number of them, that they alſo deſtroyed the vineyardes: for they delight moſt of all in ripe grapes. Yea and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith of the vngodlye: They ſhall bee partes of Foxes, that is, their pray, ſo that their karkaſes ſhall be deuoured of them. And out of the .4. chap. of <hi>Nehemias</hi> is gathered, that the number of them was ſo great, that they could in a maner ouerturne the walles of the city. And <hi>Samſon</hi> tooke them either by his own induſtry, or by the helpe of his friendes. <hi>He ſent the Foxes, and deſtroied their corne.</hi> Hereby we may gather, that in iuſt war, it is lawful to vſe burninges and ſpoilinges, to endomage their enemies.</p>

For puttinge his hope in the mercy of God, he doubted not to commit himſelf vnto his enemies, and he woulde defende the Iewes, not onely by weapons and ſtrength, but alſo wyth his greate daunger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when he was bound, they made him to aſcende.</hi> This is ſo ſayde, becauſe that rough rock which <hi>Samſon</hi> poſſeſſed, was lower then the mountaines which the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> helde. Wherefore wee reade before that <hi>Samſon</hi> diſcended to the rocke, and that the Iewes deſcended vnto him.

And he toke the iaw bone of an aſſe being new or grene. This Hebrewe woorde <hi>Teriah</hi> ſignifieth grene or new, &amp; it is ſo called, either bicauſe it was newelye drawen out of the aſſe, or els bicauſe it was rotten. For rotten thinges the Hebrewes call grene. Wherfore raw ſores and wounds ful of matter or corruption, ar called of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, grene <hi>Teriah.</hi> Theſe words (<hi>And Samſon ſaid, with the iaw of an Aſse:</hi> and then it is added in Hebrew <hi>Chamor Chamerithim</hi>) are very obſcure and haue ſundrye interpretaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For <hi>Chamor</hi> ſignifieth both an aſſe, and alſo a heap or gathering together. Wherefore ſome following the ſignification of this woord heape, do thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete it, there was made <hi>heapes vpon heapes of dead bodies,</hi> namely of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he had ſlaine. Or I haue made heape vpon heape. And the ſenſe is, that <hi>Samſon</hi> ſayth that he had made ſo greate a ſlaughter of his enemies, that he gathered greate heapes of them together. But other hauing a reſpecte vnto this woorde aſſe, do thus enterpretate it, of an aſſe, of aſſes, that it ſhould not be here vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in a metaphore. And they thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſword which is called by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> form of an aſſe. He ſaith therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iaw bone of an aſſe, of an aſſe I ſay of aſſes, as in other places of the ſcripture we reade, a kidde of goates, and a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock of Oxen. The Rabbines for the moſt part interprete this place for heapes and gatheringes together of enemies.</p>
                  <p>When the ſlaughter was finiſhed, then firſt the place was named <hi>Ramath-Lechi. Ramam</hi> in Hebrew is highe. Wherefore <hi>Ramah</hi> ſignifieth a high place. And <hi>Ramah-Lechi</hi> is nothing els then a hill or toppe of a iaw bone. There may alſo be geuen an other Etimologye, ſo that the naminge of it may be deriued of this verbe <hi>Ramah,</hi> which is to caſt away, bicauſe <hi>Samſon</hi> in that place threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the iaw bone, when he had fyniſhed the ſlaughter.</p>

And this latter interpretation <hi>Ioſephus</hi> &amp; <hi>R. Leui Ben Gerſon</hi> do follow. And they thinke, that god brought not forth water out of the iaw bone, but out of a rocke being holow like a iaw bone. But others ſay that water came forthe of that iaw bone, wherewith he had ſlayne his enemies. The place was called the fountayne of him that prayeth, bicauſe God at the prayers of <hi>Samſon</hi> opened the rocke or iawe bone. And this woorde <hi>Aim, Leui</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for an eye, for in very deede it ſignifieth eyther, namelye bothe a fountaine &amp; an eye. And the ſenſe that be gathereth is, that the eye of the Lorde was vpon him, which called vpon him, that is, God had a regarde vnto the prayers of hym that called vpon him.

                  <p>In this latter hiſtory are certayne thinges which we oughte to obſerue. The firſt is, that <hi>Samſon was bound with two cordes, and thoſe new,</hi> that the miracle mighte be the more wonderfull.<note place="margin">New cordes are ſtronge.</note> For newe cordes are more hardly broken, then old. And it is eligantly deſcribed how they brake, namely <hi>as flaxe burnt with fire.</hi> The cordes might be broken two waies, eyther bicauſe the ſtrength of <hi>Samſons</hi> body was encreaſed, or els becauſe the cordes were weakned by god: and eyther way is apt inough. Farther, when he being naked and vnarmed, was caſt forth vnto his enemies, god miniſtred weapons vnto him of a thing moſt vile: ſo can he vſe all thinges to ſetforth his glory: the iawe bone was made onely to chawe and cutte ſmall meate, but God woulde vſe it to committe a ſlaughter. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe ſometimes we ſeeme to be vnarmed agaynſte our enemies, yet are we ſufficiently armed, when god will. Some to make the thinge more probable, do imagine, that that iaw bone of the aſſe was a great one, bicauſe that in <hi>Siria</hi> are ſo great aſſes that in greatenes they may be compared with our horſes.

We may not (as I haue often admoniſhed) thinke of <hi>Samſon,</hi> as of a priuate man, for he was a Magiſtrate appointed by God, and not by men. For if he had ben a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, his actes could not be allowed: for it is wicked to violate the walles &amp; gates of Cities.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:235"/> 
                     <hi>Samſon</hi> had ſinned much more grieuouſly.

After whiche ſelfe ſame manner Monkes leade younge men and maydens to theyr inſtitutions, whom afterwarde by euill artes they make moſte corrupte. But theſe thynges haue I ſpoken by the waye.</p>
                  <p>But howe many of the Philiſtines came vnto the harlot, it is not written. Some thinke, that there were fiue, bicauſe there are ſo many pronounces in that region.

So the Philiſtines, when they coulde not conquere <hi>Samſon</hi> by ſtrength, aſſayed to wynne hym by deceate, and they allure the woman with money to betray hym.

For as in the olde tyme there were very many, ſo alſo at this daye there are not a fewe, whiche affirme that it is no ſinne.

                  <p>They whiche extenuate thys wicked crime, doo leane vnto ſundrye argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Firſte in the Actes of the Apoſtles the .15. chapter, when in thoſe firſte tymes, there aroſe a diſſention amonge the Iewes and the Gretians, it was by common aſſent decreed, that the Ethnikes ſhoulde abſteyne from bloud, from that whiche was ſtrangled, from thynges offred vnto idoles, and from fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here, ſay they, that whooredome or fornication is reckened with thoſe thynges whiche of their owne nature are not ſinnes. Wherefore it appeareth that of it ſelfe it is not ſinne: for theſe thynges were then for a tyme decreed of the Apoſtles, that Chriſtians ſhoulde lyue peaceably together. For there is no creature of GOD euill, as ſayth <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothe:</hi> Farther they ſaye, GOD woulde not commaunde that whiche of it ſelfe is ſinne. But he bad <hi>Hoſeas</hi> the Prophet to take vnto hymſelfe an harlot, &amp; to beget children of whooredome or fornication. Wherefore of hys owne nature it ſeemeth not euill. Farthermore euery ſinne is agaynſt charity, either agaynſt that charity whiche we owe vnto God, or that whiche we owe vnto our neyghbour.

To the Hebrues it is thus written: Adoulterers &amp; fornicators the Lord wil iudge: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is not ſaid to iudge &amp; to auenge, except it be for grieuous ſinnes.

To the <hi>Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> alſo, where <hi>Paul</hi> writeth of Excommunication, I doo not ſpeake (ſayth he) of all fornicators: but if any be called a brother, and is a fornicator, with ſuch ye ſhall not ſo muche as eate meate. But he entreateth muche more manifeſtly of all this matter in the ſame Epiſtle the .6. chapter, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of purpoſe: for many (as it is ſayde) were of an euill opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as touching this kynd of wickednes. Firſt, he ſayth, meate is ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the belly and the belly for meate, but God ſhal deſtroy both this and that, nowe the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord. For all meate of his own nature is pure: but for the offence of our neyghbour, we ought ſometymes to abſteyne. But ſome man myght ſay: Meate is neceſſary to lyue by. It is, ſayeth <hi>Paul,</hi> in this lyfe, but in the bleſſed reſurrection, GOD ſhall deſtroye both the meate and the belly. Wherefore thou muſte not ſo muche eſteme them, that for theyr cauſe thou ſhouldeſt offende thy brother. It is not vniuerſally commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abſteyne from all meate, but from that onely wherby thy weake brother is offended. But as touchyng fornications (ſayeth he) whiche ye contemne, the reaſon is farre otherwyſe. Your body is not geuen for fornication, but for the Lorde. And this is not to bee paſſed ouer, that <hi>Paul</hi> with greate prudence ſayeth not, not for procreation, but not for fornication. For the body is geuen alſo for procreations ſake. Men are went oftentymes to excuſe their faultes and to laye them vpon nature. The nature of the body (ſayeth he) is to bee geuen vnto the Lord. Wherfore of it is to be taken the rule of life, and not of euil examples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The nature of relatiues.</note>This is the nature of relatiues, not onely of ſuche as in that thyng that they are, are referred vnto other, but alſo of thoſe whiche are by any meanes refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto an other thynge, as the head vnto the body, and agayne the body to the head. For when we ſee the head, we ſtraightwaye require the body, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne when we ſee the body, we require the head. Suche relatiues (as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſaye) are called <hi>ſecundum dici.</hi> The Lorde is the head of the body of the Churche, and it is the body of that head. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> both wiſely and pithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputeth, when he ſayth: The body is not made to thys end, and to pollute it ſelfe with luſtes, but to bee correſpondent vnto the head, and to bee conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto it. And he addeth, GOD whiche hath rayſed vp Chriſte, ſhall rayſe vs vp alſo by his powre. The firſte argument was taken from relatiues. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde is drawen of GOD. For if he wyll rayſe vp our bodyes, as he hath ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp Chriſte, why doo we then defile them with ignominy? He goeth on and ſayeth, doo ye not knowe that your bodyes are the members of Chriſte? Shall I then take the member of Chriſte, and make it the member of an harlot? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a ſore concluſion whiche he concludeth. Shall I take (ſayeth he) the member of Chriſte? As thoughe he ſhoulde haue ſayde: No without doubt, for this were to teare the body of Chriſte. And it is a thynge moſte cruell to plucke awaye the members from a lyuely body, and to ioyne them vnto a rotten or dead body. But the ſtrength of the reaſon conſiſteth herein. Chriſte can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication: wherefore if thou wilte commit fornication, thou muſt firſte be plucked from Chriſte. Here is ſhewed that fornication is not onelye a ſinne, but alſo a deadly and moſte grieuous ſynne, whiche plucketh vs awaye from Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Afterwarde he addeth: He whiche coupleth hymſelfe vnto an harlot, is made
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18396:236"/> one body. For they ſhalbe two in one fleſhe. And: He whiche is ioyned with God is one ſpirite. This place is moſt full of conſolation: for as much as it decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that we are moſt nigh ioyned vnto Chriſt, from whom we muſt nedes be firſt plucked away, before we be made the members of an harlot. He whiche cleaueth vnto an harlot is made one body: For they ſhalbe two in one fleſhe. The Apoſtle ſeemeth at the firſt ſight to abuſe the wordes of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> For he tranſferreth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to whooredome whiche are ſpoken of matrimony. For theſe wordes were ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue:</hi> bycauſe the fleſhe of <hi>Eue</hi> was before in the fleſh of <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom God tooke a ribbe, and made therof a woman, which he agayne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> to be with hym one fleſh. But in very deede the Apoſtle abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not this ſentence, for as much as whooredome is a certayne corruption of matrimony: for one thing is common to them both, namely, the coniunction of the fleſhe. For bodyes are communicated as well here as there. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> had a reſpect vnto that whiche is common to them both, when as yet thys diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there betwene them, that in whooredome the coniunction is agaynſt the lawe of God, and therfore fornicators muſt be plucked a ſonder, otherwiſe there is lefte no hope of ſaluation for them. But in matrimony, the coniunction is made by GOD, and therfore it is made an indiſſoluble knot. Wherefore ſeyng that the coniunction is in either all one and the ſelfe ſame, <hi>Paul</hi> hath ryghtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that ſentence to whooredome: He whiche cleaueth vnto God, is one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Theſe woordes ſerue muche vnto this preſent matter. For if we be with God in ſpirite, we muſte with earneſt labor flye from thoſe thinges whiche he hath prohibited. Wherfore aptly the Apoſtle hath added flye whooredome.</p>
                  <p>He ſayth moreouer: Euery ſinne that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> committeth, is without the body: but he whiche committeth whooredome, ſinneth agaynſte hys owne body. If the argumentes whiche I haue before brought do not moue you, yet at the leaſt haue a reſpecte vnto your owne body, whiche ye ſeeme in committyng of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to hate and contemne.</p>
                  <p>But it maye be demaunded howe other ſinnes are without the body, but by fornication we ſinne agaynſt our owne body. For we doubte not, but that he whiche is very angry, nooriſheth and augmenteth choler, whereby the body is not a litle hurte. Sickenes alſo doth very muche weaken the body: wherefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayeth: A ſad ſpirite dryeth vp the bones. Dronkennes alſo and gloto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doo hynder health, and doo in a manner vtterly deſtroye the body: yea and enuious perſons ſeeme alſo to ſinne agaynſt theyr owne bodyes: For thou ſhalt ſee them dryed, withered, and in a manner kylled with leannes. Howe can it be then, that other ſinnes are without the body? Some ſaye, that fornicators doo ſinne agaynſt their owne body, bycauſe very oftentymes by hauyng fellowſhyp with harlots they are infected with the pockes, &amp; with leproſie. But let other ſay what they will, I rather thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtle had a reſpect vnto thoſe thynges which went before. For he had ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fornicator is made one body, with the harlot: &amp; he ſeemeth to ſinne grieuouſly againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignity of his body,<note place="margin">A Similitude.</note> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it all one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt vyle &amp; filthy body of an harlot. For if a kyng or prince ſhould mary a wife of a baſe and obſcure ſtocke, it would be ſaid that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated his kinred. I know that there are ſome which thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe wordes are ſpoken Hiperbollically, bycauſe there are found other ſinnes alſo whiche do hurt the body, but this hurteth it moſt grieuouſly and moſt of all.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſtill go on and ſayth: do ye not know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your bodyes are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the holy Ghoſt? And aſſuredly he which deſtroyeth the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, God wil deſtroy him. As though he ſhould haue ſayd: ye haue not your bodies of your ſelues, but of god. God hath made them his temple, and the holy ghoſt dwelleth in them. Ye are not your owne: Wherefore ye doo not a litle violate Iuſtice in contaminatyng an other mannes thyng. Ye are bought with a greate pryce,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:237"/> wherefore glorify God in your body. Theſe argumentes of <hi>Paul</hi> are both moſt pleaſaunt, and alſo moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, which if they ſatiſfy not ſome, let him loke vpon our <hi>Samſon.</hi> He was no idolatrer, no murtherer, no theſe, and yet is he taken, bound, his eyes put out, and is compelled to grinde in a priſon, euen as if he had ben a foure footed beaſt.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Clemens</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Clemens.</note> that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted harlots to weare wroughte garmentes, fine apparel, and golde, whiche thinges were not lawfull for matrones to vſe.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee what followeth in <hi>Deut.</hi> And the hire of a whore ſhall not be brought into the ſanctuary. Here again y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law calleth her <hi>Zanah,</hi> which before is called <hi>Kadſchah.</hi> But thou wilt ſay: If the law would not haue harlots ſuffred, what neded it to haue forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their oblactes? What neded this law? they which ſay this, do ſeme indede to ſpeake wittely, but yet they ſpeake not ſufficientlye. For outwarde nacions alſo ſente giftes for ornamentes and vſes of the temple. The Eunuch of the quene of <hi>Ethiope</hi> came to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to offer in the temple. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Romaines</hi> gaue yearelye oblations and ſacrifices in the temple. Wherfore the law forbiddeth, that if any thing be offred by ſtraungers, that is gotten by the gayn of a harlot, the ſame ſhould not be admitted into the ſanctuary. Farther, god had commaunded that there ſhoulde not be harlots in Iſraell, but he knew that they would not obſerue that law. For when the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtians, Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Romaines</hi> raygned ouer them, they had harlots. Yea &amp; Chriſte maketh mention of harlottes and publicanes together. Wherefore god doth rightwell firſt forbid that ther ſhould be no whores among the Hebrewes. And afterward he ordeineth, that if by any chaunce there were any, theyr gayn ſhould not be admited in to the ſanctuarye. Whiche thing vndoubtedly he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, bicauſe of the vilenes and filthineſſe of the gaine. In the ſame place he addeth: The price alſo of a dogge ſhall not be broughte into the ſanctuarye, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that beaſt is filthy and vncleane.</p>

                     <hi>Caligula</hi> otherwiſe a filthy monſter, commaunded (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth) that harlotes and baudes ſhould be openly puniſhed.<note place="margin">Suetonius Hostienſis.</note> Of this thing <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ridiculouſly. Harlots indede (ſayth he) ar bound to pay and to offer, but the church can not nor ought not to receaue them. Yet the Gloſe doth much better decre in the decretals, <hi>diſt.</hi> 90. chap. <hi>Oblationis,</hi> namely that nothing at al ſhould be offred in the church, that is of the gain of an harlot. But prieſts and monkes when they feared leaſte ſome of their profite ſhoulde departe, haue inuented an other reaſon. For althoughe, ſaye they, the gaine of harlotes cannot be receaued for an oblacion,<note place="margin">The Pope doth vniuſtlye get gaine of har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lottes.</note> yet nothing letteth but that it maye bee receaued for almes. But by what meanes doth the Pope receaue the money of harlots? Not vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as an oblation, becauſe he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not: not as almes, bicauſe he is not poore. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt he nedes receaue it as a prynce. The lord would not haue this kind of money in his ſanctuary: but the pope will haue it in hys treaſury, &amp; hath it: &amp; getteth a wonderfull greate gaine by it. Whoſe vicar then is the Pope? Gods vicar? God refuſed ſuch a gayn. What, is he Chriſts vicar? Chriſt neuer depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the will of his father. Then muſt it conſequently follow, that he is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, when as he both teacheth and doth thoſe thinges which are expreſſedlye &amp; of purpoſe againſt the word of god and of Chriſt. But he wil ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he exacteth this mony as a prince. Let him then be prince. But I wil demaund, whither he be an euil prince or a good? For a good prince it is not lawful to depart from the lawes of God. Let him then be an euill prince, let him alſo be euen <hi>Caligula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paraduenture he will aunſwere, that in reſpect he is a prince, he doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ciuil lawes, which do not take away harlots out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romaynes, yet rather they diſdayne not to decree ſomethinge touchinge theyr price or reward. In the Digeſtes <hi>de Condictione ob turpem cauſam,</hi> in the law <hi>idem etſi:</hi> it is decreed, that there can be no requiring againe, if thou geue anye thing vnto an harlot. And there is a reaſon added: bycauſe although a harlot do filthily in that ſhe is a harlot, yet ſhe receaueth not filthily, in that ſhe is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot. Theſe wordes are darke, ſo that they may ſeme to be a riddle. Farther, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> digeſts in the title <hi>de donacionibus,</hi> in the law <hi>affectionis gratia,</hi> it is decreed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is lawful to geueas wel vnhoneſtly as honeſtly.<note place="margin">It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to geue vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>honeſtly.</note> It is lawful honeſtly to geue, as vnto parents, kinſefolks friends &amp;c. Vnhoneſtly, as to harlots. But I would know, by what licenſe that is lawful? Hath god geuen goodes vnto men, to caſt them vpon harlots? But here they confeſſe there is ſome filthineſſe: for although it be lawefull to geue, yet if thou haſte promiſed anye thinge vnto an harlotte, thy oblygatyon byndeth thee not, neyther canne the harlotte require thy promes, as it is had in the gloſe, in the title <hi>de donacionibus,</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>awe <hi>ea quae.</hi> But there is a doubt, if ſhe receaue not filthily, why is it not lawfull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out filthines to require it? They aunſwere, that that followeth not: bicauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges are taken honeſtly, which are not required honeſtly. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is cited the law .1. <hi>de variis &amp; extraordinariis cognationibus.</hi> Wherfore the Pope will by the cyuill lawes not take a waye harlots, but receaue monye of them, which he ſeeth can not be ſuffred by the lawes of god. But here I will a little reaſon with him. Vndoubtedly he profeſſeth that he is ruler ouer the ciuill lawes, and in very dede he hath altered manye of them, as thoughe he woulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them: when as yet he hath taken away the good, and for the moſt part hath ſet euill in theyr place. Why hath he not amended theſe lawes for the ſuffringe of harlots, when as they ar againſt the law of God? Vndoubtedly the true cauſe why he hath not taken away the lawes of harlottes, is this, bicauſe it ſhould be to muche hurtefull vnto the Popes treaſorye. For at Rome they meaſure their lawes by profite, and not by honeſtye.</p>
                  <p>But by what ciuill law do they receaue mony of harlots? They aunſwer for
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18396:238"/> tribute. But why do they not rather ſay, for baudry? Aſſuredly,<note place="margin">What the lawes decre of baudry</note> if we wil ſpeake truely, Popes are not as touching this thing, otherwiſe then bawdes. Let them diligently marke the ciuil lawes, whereby they now go about to defende them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ouer which they boaſt that they are rulers, and let them looke what they iudge of bawdry. In the Digeſtes <hi>de ritu nuptiarum,</hi> in the law <hi>palam</hi> it is thus written: He which hath bondewomen for gayne, and filthilye ſetteth them out, &amp; is partaker of the gaine, the ſame committeth bawdry. Now I demaunde of theſe men in what condicion they count the harlottes of Rome? For citizens? Nothing leſſe. They count them therefore in a manner for bondewomen, and of them they make gaine, wherefore they are in a manner baudes. As much might be ſayd concerning vſury. They ſuffer in their dominions Iewes which ar vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and they take gayne of their vſury, euery yeare a certaine part, at the leaſte the twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty part. Wherfore the Pope is not onely a baud, but alſo an vſurer. And that which I affirme of the Pope, let prophane princes alſo take heede, leaſte the ſame may be ſaide of them alſo, which excerciſe this kind of gaine of the Iewes. To them vndoubtedlye agreeth that ſayinge of <hi>Dauid:</hi> If thou ſaweſt a theefe thou ranſt with him, and thou didſt put thy portion with adulterers.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe ar tributes.<note place="margin">What tribute is.</note> But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Code in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title <hi>de vectigalibus &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But what do harlots I praye you bring into the publike wealth? Vncleanes and filthy luſtes, of which thinges the courtiers &amp; ſacrificers of the Pope do not gather the eight parte, but the whole. Theſe thinges are called tributes and cuſtomes, which are taken of fieldes and landes, but what fields haue harlottes? What lands? None.

                     <hi>Paulus .iii.</hi> once declared that he entended ſome reformation of the Church: &amp; he committed the matter to Cardinals and Biſhops, which were counted more pure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other.

But hath <hi>Paulus .iii.</hi> ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this? In the Sinod alſo of Trident y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clergy of Rome promiſed ſome great reformacion. But they did it not, neither went they about any thing at al. Why do they not rather imitate and folow the lawes of <hi>Iuſtinian?</hi> He in is Authentikes, in the title <hi>de lenonibus,</hi> wil haue har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
<pb facs="tcp:18396:239"/> to be vtterly thruſt out of the city, and that if they promiſed any thing vnto bauds, they ſhould not be bound to pay and accompliſh the ſame. Yea rather, if they haue ſworn to be harlots for a time, he abſolueth them of theyr oth. Theſe things theſe men diſſemble, and ſuffer and maintaine harlots. Which thing yet ought not to be meruailed at. For, foraſmuch as they do ſo dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly cetain and encreaſe ſpirituall fornication of myndes, that is, ſuperſtition and idolatrye, why alſo ſhoulde they not mayntaine fornication of the bodye? But ſeinge they toke away wiues from theyr ſacrificers, it was a harde thinge, yea and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to want brothel houſes. <hi>Iuſtinianus</hi> ſorowed, bicauſe he ſaw brothell houſes nighe vnto the Churches of God, but now they dwell in the middeſt of cities, &amp; not from the houſes where holye ſeruices are miniſtred: and it nothinge gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Pope. But let the Lordes of thoſe houſes whiche the harlots dwell in, pleade theyr cauſe. But ſuch houſes pertaine for the moſt part vnto Biſhops and churches, &amp; they will ſay, we do not take part of the gain of a harlot, but as it is mete, we receaue rentes for our houſes: which is not prohibited by the ciuill lawes. For in the Digeſtes (<hi>de petitione haereditatis</hi> in the law <hi>Ancillaram</hi>) it is ſayd, that brothell houſes are occupied in the city rents of honeſt men. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame title in the law <hi>poſſeſſor,</hi> it is ordeined, that if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue vnhoneſt gaines, he ſhould be compelled to reſtore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leaſt an honeſt interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould bring profite vnto the poſſeſſor with an vnhoneſt gayne.</p>
                  <p>But bicauſe they will maintain it by lawes, why haue they not a reſpect vnto the interpretacion of thoſe lawes? That is: If this kinde of gaine bee once exacted of harlots, that ought to be reſtored vnto the hire: otherwiſe it is not law full to require them. Neyther can contrariety of lawes be auoided by any other meanes. For theſe lawes ſhould not agre with thoſe of <hi>Iuſtinians,</hi> which ar had in the Authentikes <hi>de lenonibus &amp; ſcenicis mulieribus.</hi> But let them marke I pray you the thinges which are had in the title <hi>de ritu nuptiarum,</hi> in the law <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> and in the title <hi>de iis qui notantur infamia,</hi> in the law <hi>Athletas,</hi> namely that that woman is infamous, whiche hath proſtituted herſelfe, and he alſo which is partaker of the gaine. And that vniuerſally al bawdes are infamous. Let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (which is of much more weight) haue a regard to the wordes of god which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth: Be ye holy, bicauſe I am holy. What do we gather by theſe woords? That y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not to be ſuffred among Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherby men are made infamous: wherefore take away baudes and harlots, for aſmuch as theſe kinde of perſons ar by the teſtimonie of the ciuil lawes noted infamous. But they wil ſay: Men fall very oftentimes, and ſometimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit thoſe thinges wherby they are made infamous. I graunt that, yet is not this to be borne withall, wherby wil or nill they, they ar made infamous. But thoughe they had a thouſand ciuil lawes on their ſide,<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> yet ought we more to eſteme the worde of God. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſpeakinge of thys thynge, wryteth verye well in hys Epitaphe of <hi>Fabiola:</hi> Ciuill lawes ſayth he, are not ſo diligentlye to be cited. <hi>Pampinianus</hi> writeth one thing, and <hi>Paule</hi> an other.<note place="margin">Tertulliane</note> And before <hi>Ierome, Tertulliane de anima:</hi> Brothel houſes (ſayth he) are execrable before God.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhoulde be ſuffred, ſaye they, there is ſome hope of theyr conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For Chriſt ſayth: Harlots and publicanes ſhal go before you in the kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of god.<note place="margin">How harlots do go before the Scribes and Phareſeis in the kingdome of heauen.</note> But let them tel me, whither they can by no other meanes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked into the right way, then to be borne withal? It is true indede that Chriſt ſayd: Harlots and publicanes ſhall go before you in the kingdome of God. But he vnderſtandeth not Harlots as long as they be harlots and ar not conuerted. For what cauſe then is it ſaid that they ſhal go before the Phareſeis &amp; Scribes in the kingdom of God? bicauſe they being conuerted, do acknowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile theyr ſinnes: but the Phariſeis &amp; Scribes regarded not their wicked actes, but would ſeme to be moſte holy. If harlots ſhould be ſuffred bicauſe they may be conuerted, then ſhal ther be no ſinne ſo greuous which ought to be puniſhed:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18396:239"/> for there is none ſo farre paſt grace, but there is ſome hope that he may be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into the right way: and ſo al lawes ſhall ſleepe.</p>
                  <p>They adde moreouer: God hath prohibited harlots,<note place="margin">In the tyme of Salomon there wer harlots in Iſrael.</note> as it is had in <hi>Deut.</hi> which yet were afterward ſuffred. For <hi>Salamon</hi> gaue iudgement betwene twoo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots. Firſt I anſwer, that it is not certaine that they were harlots, for as muche as this woord <hi>Zouah</hi> ſignifieth alſo her that keepeth a vitling houſe, and one al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo which getteth her liuing by ſundry kinde of gaine. Farther, though they wer harlots, yet is it a friuolous and moſt weake argument. For wee muſt not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from that which is done, to that which ought to be done. God in deede pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited harlots, but afterward diſcipline quailed, and many things were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the law. But we ought to haue a regard not to that which is done, but to that which God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to he done: otherwiſe if we will liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to examples, there are euil examples inough euery where. For Popes and Cardinals doo not onely ſuffer harlots, but alſo keepe them themſelues, as thinges moſt dainty. Neither are they afearde of the Canons which decree that Prieſtes for whooredomes ſhould be depoſed, in the diſtinction. 82. chap. <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when as yet the gloſe ſaith there: Now a daies no man is depoſed for whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The ſame is had in the ſecond queſtion .7. chap. <hi>Lator:</hi> The Apoſtle exclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth whooremongers from the kingdome of God.

For there is no creature of God euil, which is receaued with thankes geuing. Wherfore fornication is no ſyn, ſeing it is reckoned with thoſe things. But this is a weake reaſon, for theſe thinges are not reckoned of the Apoſtles, that in them ſhoulde be like reaſon of fault, but bicauſe that all thoſe thinges, if they ſhoulde haue bene vſed, would at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme haue diſturbed the Churche. The Iewes by the cuſtome of their law, abſtained from blood, and that whyche was ſtrangled: and the Ethnikes made nothing of whooredome. Wherefore, that peace ſhould be had among them all, they decreed that they al ſhoulde abſtayne from theſe thinges, wherby it followeth not, that al theſe thinges are like ſins, but rather this we may inferre, that all theſe thinges were an occaſion of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bing the Churche.</p>

                     <note place="margin">To the ſecond.</note>Farther, they obiected that God commaundeth not ſinnes, but he commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded <hi>Hoſea</hi> the Prophet to haue fellowſhip with an harlot. I aunſwer: Euerye ſynne,<note place="margin">What is the proper nature of ſynne.</note> is in that reſpect ſynne, bicauſe it is againſt the word of God. But if God commaund any thing to be done priuately, which otherwiſe diſagreeth with the woord written, the ſame vndoubtedly is not ſinne, bicauſe vniuerſally it repug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth not with the woord of God: for although it diſagreeth with the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet it diſagreeth not with the woord priuately reuealed. It is ſynne to take away an other mans good. But God, when the Hebrues ſhoulde depart oute of Egipt, commaunded that they ſhould borowe ſtuffe and ſyluer veſſels of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians, and take them away with them, which thing they did with out ſinne. No man doubteth alſo but that murther is ſynne, and yet <hi>Abraham,</hi> if hee had ſacrificed his ſonne at the commaundement of God, which he was ready to doo, had not ſynned. So may we ſay of <hi>Hoſeas</hi> the prophet: If he committed whoore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at the commaundement of God, his whooredome was no ſynne. I knowe there are ſome which thinke that <hi>Hoſeas</hi> was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but to take a harlot to his wife, but that agreeth not: for it followeth, and thou ſhalt beget of her children of fornication. Children gotten after that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, namely of a lawful wife, ſhould not haue bene children of fornication. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> doth better interprete theſe thinges Hiperbollically,<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> and ſaith, that by this image was expreſſed the wickednes of the Iewes, which had forſaken god their common huſband, and had committed fornication with the Idoles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and had begotten vnlawfull and baſtard children, as touching the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and religion of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To the thyrde.</note>Farthermore, that is falſe which they alledge, namely that whooredome is neither againſt religion, nor charitye.

                  <p>When <hi>Samſon</hi> was kept in priſon, hys heare in the meane time grew to the ſame length that it was before it was ſhauen by the harlot. God at the lengthe tooke vengeaunce of the Philiſtines, when yet he had firſt begone at hys owne houſe. For <hi>Samſon</hi> for his ſynne, came into the power of hys enemyes, and hys eyes being put out, he was compelled to grinde in priſon, and was vtterly made a mocking ſtocke. Howbeit the wicked Philiſtines in the meane tyme eſcaped not vnpuniſhed.<note place="margin">The cuſtom of God in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A ſimilitude.</note> Thus God vſeth to doo, firſt to puniſh his owne, before he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſtraungers. Phiſitions alſo, when a man hath taken poyſon, haue thys as their chiefe care, to driue away the poyſon from the hart, from the lyuer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principal partes of the body, then they apply medicines vnto the other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body. So alſo the good man of the houſe firſte enſtructeth and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his chyldren, and afterwarde he enſtructeth other. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> wryteth of a Biſhop: If he cannot wel gouerne his owne family, how ſhall hee gouerne the church of God? Wherfore it is no maruayle if god chaſtiſed <hi>Samſon</hi> fyrſt, &amp; afterward grieuouſly afflicted the Philiſtines. But in that it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that his heare was growen againe, we muſt not beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys ſtrength lay in hys heare, for it was a gift of god geuen him freely,<note place="margin">The vowe of the Nazarites being violated, was renewed.</note> but yet God required, that for that gift he ſhould be a <hi>Nazarite:</hi> vnto which it belonged, to let the heare growe, and not to cut it with a raſor. But if a man had tranſgreſſed, he did not therfore ſtraight way ceaſe to be a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> but ought to let his heare grow, and be clenſed, and ſo begyn againe his inſtitucion, which he tooke in hand. Wherefore <hi>Samſon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented that he had violated his vow, and returned to the rule of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> and when his heare was growen, and he reſtored both vnto god, and to his olde ſtate and ſtrength, being aſſured of the helpe of god, he tooke vengeaunce of hys ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time the Philiſtines aſcribe their victory againſt <hi>Samſon,</hi> vnto their god <hi>Dagon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What Dagon was.</note> But what this god was, it is not very wel knowen. Howbeit as farre as may be iudged by the Etimology of the woorde, it was ſome god of the ſea. For <hi>Dag</hi> in hebrew ſignifieth a fyſhe. And that both the Grecians and the Latines worſhipped gods of the ſea,<note place="margin">Gods of the ſea</note> it is certayne. For they had <hi>Neptune, Leucothea,</hi> and <hi>Triton.</hi> Aboue the belly (as they ſay) it had the forme of a man, &amp; downward it ended in the forme of a fyſhe. Suche a god woorſhipped the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines. And vndoubtedly the old Ethnikes ſynned grieuouſly therin, in that they woulde rather ſerue the creature (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth) then the creator, and chaunged the glory of the immortal God, and tranſferred it, not onely into the ſimilitude faſhioned like a mortal man, but alſo into the images of birdes, fourefooted bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes,<note place="margin">What maner of thinges the Gods of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes are.</note> and Serpentes or creeping thinges. Neither did they onely woorſhip thoſe things, which ar in nature, but alſo they fained vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues Monſters, which appeare no where. Such gods in a maner do heretikes woorſhip. For they doo ſet before them ſelues ſome ſhape and head of God, when they confeſſe that they heleue in God the creator of heauen &amp; earth. But when farther they adde their own thoughtes and fanſies, they make the inferiour part to ende in a fiſhe. Of this <hi>Dagon</hi> there is manifeſt mencion made in the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel.</hi> The Philiſtines extolled their <hi>Dagon,</hi> bycauſe he had deliuered their ennemye into their handes: whiche was nothing els, then to blaſpheme the name of the true
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18396:241"/> God. For they attributed his woorkes vnto an idole. Neither conſidered they that <hi>Samſon</hi> was therfore taken, bicauſe he had ſinned againſt God. Wherfore our ſynnes are a cauſe, why God is blaſphemed: for when by reaſon of them we are deſtitute of the helpe of God, our enemies, whiche get the victorye againſte vs, doo aſcribe the ſame, both vnto their owne ſtrengthes, and to their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticions.</p>
                  <p>So happened it in the conqueryng of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

Marke the goodnes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity of God: his ſeuerity on thoſe which haue fallen, and his goodnes in thee, if thou abide in goodnes: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut of. Wherefore by theſe cogitacions we may take fruite by the puniſhment of other.</p>
                  <p>For this vſe are examples ſet foorth vnto the Churche,<note place="margin">What is the fruit of holy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</note> that we in readyng them ſhoulde become better. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayde: what ſoeuer thinges are before wryt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten, are written for our learning, that wee throughe pacience and conſolacion of the ſcriptures ſhoulde haue hope.

                  <p>The Philiſtines geue thankes vnto <hi>Dagon</hi> their God for the victorye.

For how obtayned they <hi>Samſon?</hi> By the artes of an harlot, and by moſt fylthye deceate. After ſacrifices followeth a verye ſumptuous banquet. For in thoſe holye ſeruices of Idoles, was ſet foorth a certaine communion, that the people in that feaſt, ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce together wyth a certaine common ioy.</p>
                  <p>So alſo in the olde Teſtament the Iſraelites in theyr peace offeringes fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and reioyced together before the Lord.

                  <p>The Philiſtines aſſembled together aboue three thouſande men, and at the length commaunde that <hi>Samſon</hi> ſhoulde be brought before them, a man myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, bounde, and blynde.

It is a thing very cruell to adde affliction vnto the afflicted. Wherefore, althoughe God ſeemed to haue ſmytten <hi>Samſon,</hi> they oughte to haue bene touched wyth ſome mercye towardes hym, neyther muſt we be moleſtious vnto them that are ſmytten by God, as thoughe we woulde imitate God. Wherefore <hi>Amos</hi> the Prophet writeth: For three tranſgreſſions of <hi>Edom,</hi> &amp; for the fourth I wyl not be turned. For when the Iewes were dryuen and baniſhed oute of theyr owne countrey, and had eſcaped to their borders, they handled them moſte cruellye. Thys thyng, ſayth God by the Prophet, hee wyll not leaue vnpuniſhed. For althoughe the Iewes were for their deſertes afflicted of God, yet it was not the duty of neighbours to heape more iniuries vpon the afflicted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> in hys hundreth and nyne Pſalme curſeth hym which ſhoulde perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him, whom the Lord hath ſtricken.

Let hys dayes bee fewe, and let an other take hys charge. Bycauſe he remembred not to ſhewe mercye: but perſecuted the afflicted and poore man, and the ſorrowful harted to kill him.

To me belongeth vengeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; I wil render, ſaith the Lord. But in a publike cauſe the Magiſtrate ought by the commaundement and authority of God to auenge iniury: bicauſe he is gods vicar in earth: and god himſelfe, although often times he take vengeaunce of ſynnes by himſelfe, and as it is ſayde withoute meanes, yet for the moſt part he puniſheth by Magiſtrates. Wherfore thoſe wordes: To me belongeth vengeaunce, and I wyl render, doo not let the ſeueritye of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, wherby they puniſh the guilty. For they are the Miniſters of God: and that which they do, God himſelfe doth by them.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame maner of ſpeeche it is ſayd vnder the perſon of God:<note place="margin">God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth many of hys properties vnto men.</note> Equity is mine, iudgement is mine, and power is mine: all which thinges yet he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth wyth men, vpon whom hee beſtoweth them. Wherefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <hi>Samſon</hi> to reuenge the iniuries of eyther, namely of the name of God and his owne: for as muche as the Philiſtines had put out hys eyes. But for what cauſe? What, bicauſe he had committed whooredome? No vndoubtedlye:<note place="margin">For what cauſe the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Samſon.</note> but bicauſe he was an Iſraelite, a deliuerer and reuenger of the people of God. Wherefore <hi>Samſon</hi> auengeth either iniurye, both that whiche the Philiſtines had done vnto hym ſelfe, and that which they had done vnto God. When he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon God, he prayeth hym to proſper hys vocation. And ſuche prayers are woont to be of moſt efficaye. For what other thyng dyd the Apoſtles and other brethren pray for (as it is wrytten in the Actes of the Apoſtles the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) then that God would proſper their vocation and office? Geue vnto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes (ſayde they) not to regarde their threatninges, graunt them boldlye to ſpeake thy woorde. Streche foorth thine hande, that they maye woorke ſygnes. If a man will ſay, the ſygnes of the Apoſtles were profitable and healthful, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they delyuered and healed the afflicted. But contrarilye the ſigne of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> tended to the ſlaughter of his enemies. Wherfore there is not in them both one conſideration: I anſwer, that often times it happeneth ſo,<note place="margin">The ſygnes of the Apoſtles did not alwaies heale. Similitudes.</note> but yet the ſignes of the Ayoſtles alſo were ſometimes hurtful. For <hi>Paul</hi> made <hi>Elimas</hi> the Cuniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer blynde, and ſayd: Thou Sonne of the Deuyl, why peruerteſt thou the right wayes of the Lord? Beholde the hand of the Lord is ouer thee, and thou ſhalt be blynde, and ſhalt not ſee. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo wyth hys woorde ſlewe <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira.</hi> Yea and <hi>Paule</hi> delyuered manye vnto Sathan. Wherfore <hi>Samſon</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto God to make fortunate, and to helpe his miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>Neyther can it be properlye ſayde that <hi>Samſon</hi> kylled himſelfe.<note place="margin">Samſon killed not hymſelfe.</note> He dyed in deede, but he preſcribed not vnto hymſelf this ende, namely to dye. But ſought vengeaunce of hys enemies, whych he vnderſtoode woulde by this meanes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. The Apoſtles alſo dyd thus make reckonyng wyth themſelues:<note place="margin">Similitudes.</note> If as wee haue begonne we teache vnto the people the kingdome of Chriſt, vndoubtedly we ſhall bee kylled: and in that they went on wyth their purpoſe to teache the Goſpell, it cannot be iuſtly ſayd, that they kylled them ſelues. <hi>Paule</hi> alſo, when hee ſhoulde go vnto Ieruſalem, and <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet tolde hym, that the Iewes woulde bynde hym at Ieruſalem, what dyd hee when hee hearde theſe thinges? Dyd he forſake hys vocation? No verely. But rather affirmed that hee was ready both to be bounde, and to dye for Chriſt. So ſayth <hi>Samſon: Let my ſoule dye wyth the Philiſtians.</hi> He dyd not raſhely incurre death, but followeth hys vocation. Souldiours when they go on warrefare, if a man peraduenture ſay vnto them: ye ſhall be ſlayne wyth gunnes, or wyth the ſwoorde, or wyth arrowes. They wyll aunſwere, if they be men of valiaunt courage: we ſeeke not death but victorye, or we followe the defence of our owne thynges, whereunto we are called.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:243"/>
                  <p>But as touching <hi>Samſon,</hi> God gouerned him by his ſpirite. Wherefore <hi>when he dyed, he ſlewe more of the Philiſtines then he did before while he liued.</hi> What fruite therefore had the Philiſtines by their deceite and treaſon? They bought to them ſelues death, and preſent deſtruction. And euen as to them that loue god al thinges woorke to good, ſo to the aduerſaries and enemies of God, al things are turned to their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Samſon</hi> dyeth together with the Philiſtines, but the ende and maner is far diuers. For they dye in their wanton behauiour, cruelty, and idolatrye, but thys <hi>Samſon</hi> in fayth, and calling vpon the true God.

That <hi>Samſon</hi> dyed in the fayth, hereby it appeareth, bicauſe euen in the very deſtruction he called vpon God, and was heard, and bycauſe God reſtored vnto him hys old ſtrength.

Therefore the ſpirite doth with vnſpeakeable ſighinges pray for vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Samſon</hi> had before fallen, he turneth vnto god, &amp; he heareth hym. So let vs al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo, when we haue ſomtimes ſinned, returne vnto God, &amp; faithfully cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; we ſhal be heard.

The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines when they ouercame <hi>Samſon,</hi> got vnto them ſelues moſte certayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: So the Iewes, when they crucified Chriſt, threwe them ſelues into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting condemnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And that <hi>Iiphtah</hi> was ſtirred vp by the ſprite to bear rule. But before God aunſweareth the very ſharpely.

Which words when the people heard, they repented, &amp; put away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them their idols which they had made.

The order of the holy ſcriptures is of moſt high authority w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me, and therfore I thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe things happened after the death of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſon.</hi> Foraſmuch as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time euen to <hi>Heli</hi> there wer many yeares paſſed, wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                     <hi>Saule</hi> was out of that tribe choſen a king? This argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath a certain ſhew, but it is not firme nor ſound inough if a man more deligentlye examine it. For although there were but a fewe remayninge of that tribe, yet were they not ſo few, but they mought very much multiply. For there eſcaped ſixe hundreth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre, who had wiues geuen them partly of the men of <hi>Iabes Gilead,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly by violence.

But I ſee not what ſhould let, but that god might permit him to liue ſo longe. For when he had ſlaine a prince of Iſraell &amp; a Madianitiſh woman, when they were committing whoredome, god graunted him not onely to ſuccede his father in the prieſthode, but alſo gaue him very long to liue.<note place="margin">D.

And in this ſentence I follow the iudgement of <hi>Dauid Kimhi,</hi> whoſe authority in expounding of the texte I thinke is not to bee contemned. Yea and all the Hebrewes in a manner agree in this, that <hi>Pinhas</hi> liued a very long time, and there are ſome whiche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his age euen vnto the time of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophete.

                  <p>And in this hiſtory firſt I marke the inſtitution of idolatry, then the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of a prieſt, which was twiſe doone. For firſte <hi>Micha</hi> inſtituted his ſonne a prieſte: and then when by chaunce he met with a Leuite, he made him a prieſt. But wherefore was this ido le made?<note place="margin">What a vowe is.</note> For her vowes ſake. For the promiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of <hi>Micha</hi> was not ſimple, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a vow. And a vow (as al deuines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) is a holy promiſe made to God of thinges which are ours. Wherefore it muſt nedes be that this woman was a widow, with whome paraduenture her ſonne dwelled. For if ſhe had beene a wife, or a maiden vnmaried, or a widowe in the houſe of her father, ſhee coulde not haue vowed a firme vowe, as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeareth by the booke of <hi>Numb.</hi> Thoſe perſons might not vowe with out the conſent of their father or huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For the law ordeined that if they wer againſt it, the vow ſhould then be voide. <hi>Hanna</hi> did in dede vowe in the firſte of <hi>Samuell,</hi> but we muſt beleue that <hi>Helkana</hi> her huſbande confirmed her vowe. This woman ſinned, not bicauſe ſhee vowed, but bicauſe ſhee vowed a thinge vngodlye, namely, an idole. For it was at that time lawefull for anye to vowe anye thinge of his owne thinges, for the adorninge of the temple of God, and to amplify his honor. But to inſtitute a new and forbidden worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge, it was vtterly vngodly.</p>
                  <p>The ſonne had ſtolen from his mother that money: neyther is it any maruall if he would ſteale, whych was ſo redy to idolatry. He which ſinneth againſt the firſt table, doth eaſely ſinne againſt the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The mother curſeth the theefe, whoſoeuer he were:</hi> neyther doth ſhe ſo gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly take the matter for the money taken away, as for that ſhe could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme her deteſtable vow. And ſhe curſeth, as men in a manner vſe to do, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities. Yea and God himſelf alſo vſed curſes in the old teſtament, in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly to the mount <hi>Hebal</hi> &amp; <hi>Garizim.</hi> The prieſt alſo curſedly prayed for bare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, diſeaſes, loſſe of children, and other thinges of like ſorte. And in our time, the Pope,<note place="margin">Women do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely fall to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges.</note> by what wicked zeale I know not, in the day of the ſupper of the Lord ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>The ſonne as ſoone as he heard the curſe of his mother, was a feard. For ſo hath nature ordeined, that children do wonderfully feare the curſes of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. But this man feared not to violate the lawe of God: which thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not ſeldome vnto men, to haue horror of ſmall ſinnes, and to neglect them that ar more grieuous.

To the ſeconde kinde of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try perteineth the ſinne of this woman. As often as we heare an image that is made, and a ſtraunge God not added, we muſte vnderſtand that that image was made vnder the ſhew of the worſhipping of the true god: but that religion is far contrary to the inſtitution of ſound religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore when the people (as it is written in <hi>Exodus</hi>) made themſelues a golden calfe, <hi>Aaron</hi> proclaimed a holye day vnto the Lord, that is to the true god, and not to an idole. For they counted it abſurd, to worſhippe, either the true god himſelf without an image, or els an image without the title of the true God. And ſo muſte we thinke that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did when he conſecrated the golden calfes in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> For I doo not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that in images he inſtituted the worſhipping of <hi>Baal,</hi> or <hi>Aſtharoth,</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> but he would vnder them worſhip the Lorde.

And it was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtable to worſhip god with oblations and ſacrifices in any other place, then in that which he himſelfe had choſen to be worſhipped in.

                  <p>Why theſe two wordes <hi>grauen and molten</hi> are ſo ioined to gether,<note place="margin">Grauen and molten.</note> the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors do doubt. Some of the Hebrewes and ſome of our writers doo thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were two images, of the which the one was grauen, and the other molten. But this ſemeth not to be ſo, bicauſe theſe woordes are oftentimes ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the holy ſcripture: neyther is it neceſſary, as often as we finde them, ſo to vnderſtande many images. Other thinke that that image was firſt molten and then grauen, or wroughte. The opinion of other is, that wee ſhoulde reade gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and molten diſiunctiuely, that is, an image which was either grauen or mol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten. But I very wel allow the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Dauid Kimhi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">D.

And ſo in one and the ſelfe ſame image was either: For it was both grauen, &amp; the plates alſo were molte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; extenuated to lay ouer it.

                  <p>There is a fable among the Hebrewes, that this woman was <hi>Dalila</hi> whiche deceaued <hi>Samſon,</hi> as though ſhe had receaued this mony for the rewarde of her prodicion.

Wherfore that the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churche may be the quieter, there muſt be one head therof in earth. But we neither wil, nor may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this: bycauſe it is manifeſtly repugnant vnto the word of God. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one head of the Church that is Chriſt, from whom we fele that both lyfe &amp; ſpirite floweth and ſpreddeth abrode into all the reſt of the body.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay there muſt alſo be an other head of the Church. For Chriſt (ſay they) is the head as touching the ſoule and iuſtification. But there muſt be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head alſo, concernyng the retayning of outward rites and ceremonies, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wedyng out of hereſies, &amp; to vnite Churches together.

Let theſe men euery one execute his office, let them conferre together, if there happen any controuerſy, and if neede be, let them aſſemble together to Synodes. But that euery controuerſy ſhould be referred vnto the Byſhoppe of Rome, and that all men ſhoulde obey the Pope onely, it is intollerable, and vtterly Tyrannicall.</p>
                  <p>Neither doo the Popes contayn themſelues,<note place="margin">Popes do alſo chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of God.</note> to excerciſe power onely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thinges, but alſo they chaunge the inſtitutions of God, and rules of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Which thyng we haue now had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great hurt of the Church. It is a very good ſaying whiche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle hath vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> in the .12. chap. Euen as in one body we haue many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, but all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers haue not one &amp; the ſelfe ſame office: ſo we being many are one body in Chriſt, &amp; euery one the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of others, hauing ſundry giftes according vnto the grace geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs. And the ſame things in a maner are written in the .1. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Wherfore we muſt not thinke that if we acknowledge not the Pope for head, that for that cauſe the Churche is troubled: yea rather hereof ſpringeth the contention and confuſion in the Churche, bycauſe many, for that they will haue the Pope to be head, do moſt manifeſtly ſtand agaynſt the truth.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it true that they ſay, how that the Church can not conſiſte,<note place="margin">The Churche was long tyme and that happy without a earthly head.</note> except all men obey the Pope onely. For the Church was long tyme and that in much better ſtate, before the Pope obteyned his tyrannycall power. Then (ſay they) ye will haue no Magiſtrate in the Churche.

Wherfore we rede in this boke that the <hi>Danites</hi> were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to dwell in the hilly places, when they could not diſcend and poſſeſſe the playne. But now thoſe hilly places ſeemed very narrowe, for they increaſed in number, and therfore they neded more roome to dwell in.</p>

This is to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god after our blind reaſon, At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt burnt it may ſeeme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpyes did not euil. For it is a point of piety to aſke cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal do any thing. But we ought to take hede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ſoeuer is taken in hande, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame be ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> right reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſound iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde.

But faith leaneth to no other thyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God.<note place="margin">Fayth is the ſoule of good workes.</note> Wherfore for aſmuch as theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund to aſke counſel of God contrary to the word of God, they do exceadingly diſpleaſe God: they were more led by their own commodity, then by true piety. So many at this day ſay: What euil is it to come to Maſſe? and there, with a godly mynd to pray vnto god? The Maſſe hath a great ſhew of piety: but we muſt remember that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be good, for as muche as it is appertly repugnant to fayth, and to the worde of God. Let euery manne take heede he bee not deceaued with the outwarde ſhewe of piety: and let hym diligently conſider, that outwarde woorkes make not a man good, but rather contraryly good workes muſt procede out of a good man.</p>
                  <p>But now come I to examine, &amp; conſider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is here intreated as touching
<pb facs="tcp:18396:249"/> the aſking counſell of God,<note place="margin">The commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king counſel of God is moral.</note> &amp; I finde that it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in things of great difficulty y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynde of the Lord is to be enquired of. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoughe it were geuen vnto the Iewes, yet it pertayneth to the moral kinde of preceptes. Wherfore it byndeth vs alſo. But vnto the Iewes were adioyned certayne out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonyes, from which we are by Chriſt deliuered. They were bound to come to the Prieſt, to the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and to the place of the arke of the couenant, or to the Prophet: thoſe things are now taken away. And yet ought we alſo, when we take in hand to do any thyng, to aſke counſell of the Lord, but remouyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way theſe addicions, which were neceſſary in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publique wealth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites.

This is to aſke counſell of the Lord, which thing if we do not, we ſhalbe alway in doubt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs.

                     <note place="margin">The eſtate of the Hebrues &amp; ours is diuerſe</note>But why the Hebrues were ſo careful for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe of their matters, we haue in an other place declared. Their ſtate was not all one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ours. They wer much careful for their publique wealth, bicauſe God had promiſed them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Chriſts tyme. Neither was true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other place publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receaued.

Wherfore god alſo very oftentimes gaue them oracles for their euentes. But our ſtate is farre otherwiſe.

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inheritance of Chriſt is diſperſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, neither ſhall it endure ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, as one onely publique wealth ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. But rather if one publique wealth fal by reaſon of ſinnes, an other ſhall riſe. If there ariſe perſecutions for the Goſpell ſake (which ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tymes happeneth) it is lawfull to departe to an other place, whiche thyng was not ſo free for the Iewes, for they had not a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of god, &amp; his outward worſhipping in any other, then at <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Superſtition &amp; idolatry poſſeſſed all other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Wherfore for aſmuch as ſuch difficultyes are farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſeke out by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures, whether thoſe things, which we do &amp; medle with, do pleaſe god.

                  <p>Let ſuche foretellynges be referred vnto the .13. chapter of <hi>Deuteronomye,</hi> where it is thus written: If a Prophet ryſe vp among you, or a dreamer of drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and ſhall geue thee a ſigne or wonder, and that whiche he hath foretolde thee come to paſſe: Thou ſhalt not harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his voyce.

If the good man of the houſe knewe what tyme the theefe woulde come, he would vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlye watche, neither would he ſuffer hys houſe to be inuaded. We oughte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to praye and watche, bycauſe although the ſpirite be ready, yet the fleſhe is weake. <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth vs to put on the armour of God, that wee maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyſt in the euyll day. Stande (ſayth hee) wyth your loynes gyrded wyth the gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of truth, putting on thee the breſt plate of ryghteouſnes, and hauing ſhooes on your feete, to be readye to the Goſpell of peace, aboue all thinges taking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the ſhielde of fayth, whereby ye may quenche all fyry dartes of that euyll one, and take vnto you the ſalet of health, and the ſwoorde of the ſpirite, whych is the woorde of God. So doth <hi>Peter</hi> alſo arme vs againſt ſecurity, in hys fyrſte Epiſtle, the fyft chapter: The Deuil (ſayth he) your enemye goeth aboute lyke a roaryng Lyon, ſeeking whom he may deuour: reſiſt him being perfect in fayth.</p>

                     <note place="margin">There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fear which is euyl.</note>But bycauſe I haue ſayd that Security is contrarye vnto feare, I wyll not that any man ſhould thinke that all maner of feare is to be prayſed. Bycauſe there is alſo an euyll feare. And that ſpryngeth of an euyll iudgement of good and euyll thynges. As if a man ſhoulde thyncke that the aduerſities of thys worlde, and the croſſes whych the elect ſuffer, are both altogether euyll, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye to be feared. Agaynſt theſe thynges we muſt ſyng together wyth <hi>Dauid:</hi> I wyll not feare what man doth vnto me.

As they whych in a feuer either colde or whot, bycauſe inwardlye they are colde or whot, are more grieuouſlye ſycke, then if there were heate or colde applyed outwardly to theyr bodyes: So they which are vexed in the mynde, are much more tormented, then they which are afflicted in the bodye. After the ſame maner we may ſaye, that they alwayes tremble and are afrayde, whoſe conſciences are troubled. Wherfore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid: They haue trembled for feare, where as no feare was. So <hi>Cain,</hi> and ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> alſo were wonderfully afrayde.<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> vnto <hi>Lucillus,</hi> in hys hundreth and ſyxe Epiſtle ſayth, that no place ſhall make a wycked man quiet. For thus he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thinketh: Though I be not yet taken now, yet I maye at the length bee taken. And that I haue not hitherto bene taken, it came rather of fortune, then of confidence. They alſo doo exceedingly feare, whych are them ſelues horrible and fearefull vnto other. For he muſt needes feare many, whom manye feare.</p>
                  <p>Agaynſt ſuche feares <hi>Seneca</hi> hath inuented remedies, namely that we ſhould lyue iuſtly,<note place="margin">Remedyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt euil feare</note> and commit nothing that is wycked. But by thys meanes, who can at any tyme be ſecure? For who is he which ſynneth not? But we muche better reſt our ſelues in the fayth of Chriſt, and put all our confidence and ſecuritye in his mercy onely. After thys maner <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs: Being iuſtified (ſayth hee) by faith,<note place="margin">Carefulnes is not alwaies lau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dable.</note> we haue peace with God. This medicine is of force againſt al diſeaſes. Alſo Carefulnes, which ſeemeth to be contrary vnto Security, is not alwayes to be prayſed: bycauſe in it are twoo vices to be taken heede of. The firſt is, that being moued with it, we ſeeke not by iniuſt meanes to remedye an euyll that commeth vnlooked for, as the Iewes dyd when they ſayde: If wee ſuffer thys man to lyue, the <hi>Romanes</hi> wyll come, and ouerthrowe our place and Nacion. Wherefore they decreed to deſtroy hym.</p>
                  <p>Farthermore we muſt beware, that we be not ſo moued for temporall thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to caſt awaye our hope and confidence of the goodnes and prouidence of God.<note place="margin">What is the true and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Security.</note> Wherefore the true Security is that whych is receaued by fayth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of the promiſes of God. <hi>Paule</hi> dyd put vs in mynde of thys, when hee wrote vnto the <hi>Romanes:</hi> If God haue geuen hys Sonne for vs, how ſhall not he geue vs all thynges wyth hym? Who ſhall lay any faultes agaynſt the electe of God? It is God whyche iuſtifieth, who then ſhall condemne? It is Chriſte whych dyed, yea and whych roſe agayne, who ſytteth alſo at the right hande of God, and maketh interceſſion for vs. Who ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of God? Shall affliction?

                        <p n="2">2 And hys Concubine playde the whoore there, &amp; went away from him vnto her fathers houſe to Bethelehem Iuda, &amp; ther continued a few dayes, namely foure monethes.</p>

                  <p>By reaſon of ſundry calamities and plagues wherewith the Philiſtians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the people of their greuous ſynnes, the Iſraelites had nowe no lawfull Magiſtrates: wherby came to paſſe that many wycked actes were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, the woorſhipping of God violated, and ciuill warres aroſe, which muſt nedes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, where ſynnes remayne vnpuniſhed. And that whych mought haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned by the puniſhment of one or twoo, brought the deſtruction of manye thouſandes, both of the Iſraelites, and alſo of the <hi>Beniamites.</hi> We ſhal ſee in this hyſtory (whych the holye ghoſt referreth to the ende of thys booke) fyrſte a moſte haynous wycked acte of the <hi>Beniamites.</hi> Secondlye vengeaunce taken of that Tribe by the other Tribes, wherby the <hi>Beniamites</hi> were in a maner cleane deſtroyed. And laſtly we ſhal heare the wonderful inſtauracion of that Tribe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:254"/>
                  <p>The occaſion of this warre was thus. A certaine man being a <hi>Leuite,</hi> had a wyfe, who committed adultery, and fearing the ſharpenes of her houſband, fled to her Parentes. Not long tyme after, her huſbande went to ſeeke her, fyndeth her, and is reconciled vnto her. The woman as ſhee returned home together wyth her huſband, was with moſt fylthy whoredome defiled of the <hi>Gabaonites,</hi> whereby ſhe miſerably periſhed, &amp; ſo ſuffred puniſhment for her fyrſt aduoutry. For God puniſheth ſynnes by ſynnes. Neither ſuffered he adultry being not pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed by the Magiſtrates, to go vnpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>As touching the hiſtorye, it is no marueilous or ſtraunge thing, that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite</hi> dwelt as a ſtraunger. For althoughe that Tribe had certaine Cities and ſuburbes appointed it, yet very many of the <hi>Leuites</hi> went to the townes and vil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lages of the other Tribes, to ſerue them as touching doctrine &amp; counſels: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue a litle before ſomwhat ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This man dwelt as a ſtraunger on the ſyde of mount Ephraim.</hi> The Hebrewe woord ſignifieth a ſide, a hyp or thigh. And by tranſlacion it ſignifieth a region or coaſt. And this is a very elegant Metaphore, when there is mencion made of a mountaine. He dwelled therfore on the ſide of mount <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He tooke a wyfe a Concubine.</hi> By this place is manifeſtlye gathered, that the Concubines of the Fathers were wiues. For the Iewes were not bound to the lawes of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> when as both at this tyme they were not made, and alſo they pertayned not to that nacion. Whych I therefore ſpeake bycauſe the <hi>Romanes</hi> had Concubines, which were not wiues. But the Hebrewes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called their wyues Concubines, bycauſe they were not of the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity that their wyues were, which had authority in the houſe. Yea the Maiſter ſometimes maryed his handmayden, as <hi>Abraham</hi> maryed <hi>Agar, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Bilham</hi> and <hi>Zilpa.</hi> Peraduenture in contracting of thoſe matrimonies there wanted tables, or ſome outward ceremonies, wherwith they vſed to adorne the principal matrimonies. Neither yet was that a let, but that theſe were matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Of this thing I haue ſpoken largely before. Wherefore I will at thys tyme ceaſe to go any farther therein.</p>
                  <p>But in that the <hi>Leuite</hi> had a wyfe, whiche was of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> it is not to be marueiled at: bicauſe vnles maydens were inheritours, they mought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in other tribes, which thing was not permitted to thoſe that had inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to the ende that poſſeſſions ſhould not be confounded. Farther, foraſmuche as the tribes of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> excelled the other in dignitye, they were the eaſelyer coopled together in matrimony. For the principality ſeemed wel to agree wyth the Prieſthood. It is called <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Iuda,</hi> to put a difference from the other <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as we haue before declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She committed aduoutry by hym.</hi> We might alſo ſay againſt him. For ther is great iniury done vnto the man, when the wife playeth the whoore. And this prepoſicion <hi>All</hi> ſignifeth either. But the plainer ſenſe is <hi>by him.</hi> As thoughe it ſhould haue bene ſaid that ſhe committed aduoutry, when ſhe was yet together with her huſband, and had not departed from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She fled to her father.</hi> Being ſo afearde of her huſbande that ſhee durſt not come in his ſight, ſhe got her to her fathers houſe. Adultery is committed, which is a grieuous crime, and yet is not puniſhed by the puniſhment of the lawe, for that there was no Magiſtrate to execute iudgementes. And thoughe in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aduoutry is a grieuous wicked act,<note place="margin">The wyfe of a Miniſter if ſhe be an adultres, ſynneth more grieuouſly then other.</note> yet in the wyfe of a <hi>Leuite</hi> or Prieſt it is farre more grieuous, for as muche as the holye miniſterye ought to bee well ſpoken of. Wherefore if the daughter of a Prieſt had played the harlot in her Fathers houſe, ſhe was not ſtoned as other were, but burnt with fyre, as it is expreſſedly wrytten in <hi>Deuteromy.</hi> But why this adultreſſe was not ſlaine, the cauſe (as it is before ſayde) was, for that there was no Magiſtrate in Iſrael.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18396:254"/> And this adultereſſe might think to herſelf y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe had eſcaped puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">This adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous woman eſcaped not the puniſhmente of God.</note> as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge men, but ſhe could not eſcape the hand of God. For god ſhall iudge adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and whoremo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, as the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes teacheth, which thing he doth ſometimes by magiſtrates: and ſometimes when they ceaſe, by himſelf. The woman was with her parents .4. monthes, in which ſpace of time, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being either moued with mercy, or wearied with ſolitarines, went to ſeke hys wyfe, and <hi>to ſpeake to her harte.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two manner of wayes of pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhinge the guilty.</note> By this Hebrewe phraſe is ſignified that he would comfort her being in miſery and afflicted, or geue her ſome profitable counſell, peraduenture that ſhe ſhould repent her of the ſinne which ſhe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, promiſing her that if ſhe would do ſo, he woulde receaue her into fauor agayne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ioined a coople of Aſſes.</hi> That he might haue one to cary his wife, and the other to lade with thinges neceſſary for his iorney. The wife as ſone as ſhe ſaw him, <hi>brought him into her fathers houſe.</hi> By whiche acte ſhee declareth that ſhee was not vtterlye alienated from her huſbande. <hi>The father of the maiden,</hi> that is his father in lawe, <hi>mette him and ioyfully embraſed him.</hi> Whereby we gather, that the old man alſo wiſhed a reconcilement betwene them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He abode there three dayes.</hi> He abode there in verye dede fiue dayes: but thre dayes willingly, the other two dayes he was in a manner compelled by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law. <hi>And they did eate and drinke.</hi> Theſe thinges declare that they were reconciled, and that the matrimony was renewed betwene them. But when he would haue departed, the father in law ſayd:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt ſtrengthen thy hart with a morſell of breade.</hi> And by this woorde breade he vnderſtode all kinde of meate. The old man would not ſo ſone let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go, bicauſe he deſired to haue fauor and loue confirmed betwene them, to thend they ſhould not afterward be eaſly ſeperated, the one from the other: This was his purpoſe. <hi>Behold the day is weakened.</hi> He vſeth a Metaphore, and ſignifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſage of the Sunne to the weſt, &amp; that there was a little of the day remaining. So alſo men when they come to age, ar weakned in the body. The <hi>Leuit</hi> would tary no longer: which turned to his greate hurt.</p>
                  <p>Let vs by the way note in this place, that for him which ſhal make a iorney it is vnprofitable to tary long at banquetings. For commonly they ar oppreſſed with night, before they can come to theyr lodginges.</p>
                  <p>Now it ſemeth that I ſhould entreate of adulteries, wherby I might declare the nature and greiuouſnes of that ſinne, and ſetforth the puniſhmentes of that crime, which ar appointed both by the ciuil laws &amp; by the eccleſiaſtical, but theſe ſhalbe ſpoken of when wee are come vnto the hiſtory of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who committed moſt filthy adultery with <hi>Bethſaba.</hi> Now I haue determined to entreate onelye of the reconſiliation of the huſband and the wife, after the committing of adulte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, and I will touch the whole matter briefly.</p>

                  <p>THe ciuil lawes are vtterly againſt the reconciliation of the huſband and the wife, after the one hath committed adultery.<note place="margin">The ciuill lawes abhorre from reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery.</note> For in the Code <hi>ad. l.

And in the ſame title in the law <hi>Crime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> it is had, that he which retaineth ſtill in matrimonye a wife that hath played the adultereſſe, can not accuſe her of adultry. Although afterward by a new law it was otherwiſe prouided for. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it a light thinge to be condemned is a bawde: but it was euen as grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb facs="tcp:18396:255"/> as if a man had ben conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned of adultry.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon the .19. chapter of <hi>Mathew</hi> may appeare to agree with the ciuil lawes. For he writeth: ſhe which hath deuided one fleſh into one or two, ought not to be retained, leaſt her huſbande be made ſubiect vnto the curſe. For as it is written in the .18. chapter of the Prouerbes: He which retaineth an adultreſſe, is vngodly and a foole. In dede ſo haue the .70. interpreters turned it, but the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Hebrewe hath it not. The ſame <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith: If there happpen any ſin, it breaketh not matrimony. But if ther happen adoultery, then the wife is not lawfull. And in the .32. queſtion the firſt, ar rehearſed the words of <hi>Chriſoſtome.</hi> If a manne haue to doe with an adulterous wife, let him do penaunce. And the ſame <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon the .26. chap. of <hi>Mathew:</hi> Euen as he is vniuſte whiche accuſeth an innocent, ſo is he a foole which retayneth an adultereſſe. The ſame thing is had in the decretals <hi>de Adult.</hi> in the chap. <hi>Si vir ſciens:</hi> And it was decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the counſell of <hi>Orleaunce.</hi> The huſband which retaineth an adultereſſe is partaker of the crime. And if a woman repudiated, marye an other, her laſte huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being dead, ſhe can not return vnto the firſt. For now ſhe is vncleane vnto him, as it is written in the .24. of <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now omitting theſe thinges, let vs ſee the reaſons which ſerue for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. God himſelfe which is onely good, would be the huſbande of the church, and that not onely in our time, but alſo in the times of the fathers. But the church, eſpecially the old church, oftentimes turned aſide to idolatry, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which ſelfe thinge <hi>Hoſeah</hi> the prophet alſo did, &amp; that with many words. And if god be redy to receaue his wife beynge an adultereſſe, man ought alſo to returne into fauor agayne with his wife, eſpecially if ſhe repent, and beginne a new life. For as many as are chriſtian men, profeſſe the imitation of God.

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted adultery, as ſuch, as which were now polluted &amp; contaminated.

Theſe thinges are had alſo in 32. queſtion .1. If ſhe haue fallen, thou muſt know it came of humayne nature, &amp; mercy muſte be ſhewed her, if ſhe ariſe.

                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:18396:255"/> An adultreſſe if ſhe repent, ought to be receaued. The gloſe in that place demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth, by what right or dewty ſhe ought to be receiued. It anſwereth: Not by the lawe of neceſſitye, for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man wil not, he cannot be compelled to receaue her, wherfore he ought by the law of honeſty to take her agayne. But I woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund whither it ought not alſo to be done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dewty of piety &amp; by the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the commaundement of God, foraſmuch as <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Philip.</hi> ſaith, do theſe things, whatſoeuer ar honeſt and iuſt? Therfore it is alſo don by neceſſity of the commaundement. But the gloſer in that place intreated of the outward iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, wherein no man can be compelled to receaue an adultereſſe. But in the Cannon now cited it is added: Not very often. For if ſhe fal often into adultry, ſhe ought not to be receaued. The Gloſe in the ſame place obiecteth vnto it ſelf chriſt, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhuld forgeue our brother whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he offendeth againſt vs, anſwered not onely ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times, but ſeuenty ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times. To this he ſayth, that the words of the Canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adultereſſe ſo oftentimes falleth, the church ſhall not entreate for her reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, partelye bycauſe there ſhoulde be opened a wyndowe to wyckednes,<note place="margin">When the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che ought to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treate for thoſe that fall.</note> and partly bycauſe ſhe might thinke that penaunce is but fayned and deſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. There is alſo added an other aunſwere, that that is ſpoken for a terrour, leaſt men ſhould more freely and careleſly commit ſinne. Hereby is gathered that the church oughte to entreate for the reconciliation of the repentant, that they may be reconciled. Wherfore an adultreſſe, either ſheweth ſignes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, or els ſheweth not. If ſhe ſhew ſignes, the church oughte to entreate for her, that there may be a reconciliation made. But if ſhe ſhewe none, the churche ſhall not entreate for her: otherwiſe it ſhould ſeme to maintain ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt we aunſwere vnto the arguments which ſemed to be agaynſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.<note place="margin">Aunſweres vnto the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary part. The counſell of Orleance. The cauſe why the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes prohibited the returne of a wyfe repudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her firſt huſbande.</note> As touching the ciuill lawes they are to be corrected by the word of God. <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> do ſpeake of ſuch an adultreſſe whiche repenteth not, which ſelfe ſame thing is manifeſtly vnderſtand by the counſel of <hi>Orleance.</hi> For that it is there had: He whiche retaineth an adultreſſe, is partaker of the crime: but if ſhe repent, let her be receaued. But why the lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffred not, that a wife repudiated ſhould not after the death of her latter huſbande re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto her firſt, the cauſe may eaſely be aſſigned. For if he had permitted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, then diuorſements would eaſely haue bene had, in hope ſomtimes to recouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne theyr wife. God would that ſhe that was repudiated, ſhoulde returne no more, to the ende that ſhee ſhoulde not eaſelye bee repudiated. There mighte alſo bee conſpiracies made agaynſte the latter huſbande, whereby the wyfe myghte, when hee were dyſpatched awaye, returne agayne vnto her firſte huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. Wherefore the lawe of God was moſte iuſte, whiche pertayned not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adultrous women, which by the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God ought to be ſtoned. By theſe thinges now it is manifeſt that it is lawfull for the huſband to return into fauor with his wife being an adultereſſe, ſo that ſhe repent: who yet ought to accuſe his wife of adultry, if it be a publike crime, or if ſhe perſeuer in her wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kednes, or els if ſhe bring forth any children by adultry, leaſt the lawful heires ſhould be defrauded: for vnleſſe ſhe be accuſed, the huſbande cannot depriue the ſon borne in adultry, but that he ſhall inherite. Farther, let the church entreate and work with him, that he would receaue againe the woman being repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Wherfore our Leuite ought not to be reproued, bicauſe he receaued again into fauor his wife being an adultreſſe, ſo that ſhe repented her of her adultery. But now will I return to the interpretation.</p>

He aunſwereth, whome that puniſhement moueth not, for them abydeth the vnquencheable fyre. And they are not ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in this lyfe, bycauſe ſuche menne for the moſte parte are conuerſaunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge good menne: and GOD promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue <hi>Sodome,</hi> if there mought haue bene founde there but onely tenne good menne. Wherefore for as muche as Cityes at this daye are not altogether ſo corrupte, as <hi>Sodome</hi> was then, therefore GOD dealeth more remiſſedly with them. It alſo oftentymes happeneth, that althoughe theſe men are moſte wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet they had good predeceſſors. And GOD (as he hath teſtified) tarieth, and differreth the puniſhement vnto the thyrde and fourth generation. Farther, we muſte marke that thys vice whereſoeuer it rangeth, it is not alone. With it are ioyned cruelty, inhumanity, pryde, robbery, and oppreſſing of the poore. And when it ſhall come to this point, that menne cruelly withdrawe their dewtyes from their neyghbours, GOD doth then on the other ſide withdrawe hys helpe and grace. Wherefore they beyng left vnto themſelues, that is, vnto their owne corrupte and viciate ſtrengthes, doo degenerate into beaſtes.<note place="margin">The Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſinne is to bee puniſhed with death.</note> The lawe of GOD in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> made thys ſinne death.

                     <note place="margin">Lex Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinia.</note> whiche was of the ſame ſhapenes.

                  <p>But it is to be knowen that euen GOD bendeth hymſelfe to vengeaunce,<note place="margin">☜</note> and ſendeth fury and madnes vpon ſuche perſons, where the Magiſtrate neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his dewty, and ſuffreth wicked menne to go vnpuniſhed. Therefore in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> it is written that the aungelles ſmote the <hi>Sodomites</hi> with blyndnes, ſo that they could not finde the houſe.</p>
                  <p>We muſte alſo note that the <hi>Gabaonites</hi> came in a manner all of them vpon a heape vnto the doore, that it myght appeare that they all conſpired into thys ſo deteſtable a crime.</p>
                  <p>But there ariſeth a doubt, whether ſinne may by any meanes be excuſed for
<pb facs="tcp:18396:260"/> this cauſe,<note place="margin">Sinne is not excuſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bycauſe it is publique.</note> bycauſe it was common, and almoſt all men were infected with it? No vndoubtedly, yea rather it was ſo muche the more wicked and heynous, as it was committed of many, and that without puniſhement. For they dyd not onely conceaue and committe wickednes, but alſo publiſhe and ſet it forth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without ſhame ranne together to accompliſhe it. Wherefore it is rightly written, that the ſinnes of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> cried and aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vp into heauen. <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo writeth: They haue publiſhed abrode their ſinne like <hi>Sodoma.</hi> And where we ſee that done, we muſt thinke that it is a certayne token, that that publique wealth ſhall in ſhorte tyme periſhe. For menne when they are touched with ſome ſhamefaſtnes, althoughe they ſinne, yet remayneth there ſome hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement and repentaunce. But when in a manner they openly profeſſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actes, and write bokes of them, and wil haue theyr wicked crimes to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, there is nothyng elles to be looked for, but the vengeaunce of God. With thys wicked vyce the Prelates and Papiſticall Sacrificers in theſe dayes are chiefely infected, and alſo the Antechriſtes of Rome, vnto whom matrimony is very odious.</p>
                  <p>Let vs alſo conſider the goodnes of God, whiche ſtirreth vp this olde man, to admoniſhe, and reproue them, and to bryng them agayne into the ryght waye. They were menne polluted and contaminated and vtterly vnwoorthy of ſo great a benefite. But there are neuer men ſo euill, but that GOD doth by ſome meanes admoniſhe them of their ſynnes. The olde man dyd his dewty: but they contemne and deride him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He brought foorth hys concubine.</hi> Who? Not the olde manne, but the <hi>Leuite,</hi> who deliuered his wife, for feare leaſt he ſhould hymſelfe haue fallen into their power. But why did not the olde manne delyuer his daughter alſo? Paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bycauſe thoſe Citezins cared not for her beawty, who yet counted the wife of the <hi>Leuite</hi> to be very fayre and beautifull. They ſo afflicted her all the nyght, that in the mornyng ſhe dyed. Theyr wicked crime turned at the length into murther. In this place the hande and vengeaunce of GOD ſheweth forth it ſelfe. This woman hauyng before committed adultery, and not for it iuſtly puniſhed,<note place="margin">The adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe as ſhe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo is ſhe pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> at the length dyeth euen in adultery, and ſuffreth the lawe of the lyke. But whether ſhe repented at laſt or no, there is nothyng written of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We onely ſee the outwarde thynges, it is GOD whiche ſearcheth the heartes. But if ſhe dyd repent, and that with fayth, then eſcaped ſhe eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhementes. Yet GOD will haue diſcipline eſtabliſhed in publique wealthes, and the malefactors puniſhed, who if they repent, then are they fatherly chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynges, and not puniſhementes. Neither is it lawfull for the Magiſtrate to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecte his office, althoughe they repent: for if they doo ceaſe to puniſhe, God (as it is before ſayd) will by hymſelfe reuenge. Wherfore that whiche is written to the Hebrues: Whoremongers and adulterers GOD will iudge, may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand two manner of wayes, bycauſe God ſometymes puniſheth by himſelfe, and ſometymes by the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Leuite layd his concubine beyng dead vpon the Aſſe, went home and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided her body into twelue partes, whereof he ſent into euery tribe a parte.</hi> But it may be demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,<note place="margin">Howe the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite diſtributed the pieces.</note> how he ſent twelue parts into euery tribe, when as they wer 13. number.

But this ſentence ſeemeth not probable, bycauſe it was the ſinne onely of one City, &amp; therefore it pertayned not vnto the whole tribe: vnles peraduenture we will ſay, that he ſuppoſed that the <hi>Beniamites</hi> were of ſuch mindes, that they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18396:260"/> woulde not know and take vengeance of the offences of theyr owne bretherne. Neither was he deceaued in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>He was compelled ſo to do, bicauſe ther was then no Magiſtrate in Iſrael, neyther any certayn place of iudgement where he might plead his cauſe.

And it ſemeth that he more profited by this meanes, then he ſhoulde haue done if he had vſed letters or ſpech. For thoſe things do very much moue, which are ſet forth before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies. And yet in ſo doing he ſought not reuengeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, either by a wicked or by an vnlawful meanes, foraſmuch as he did not tumultuouſly call ſouldiers together, neyther raiſed vp ſedicions, or inuaded the city, which did him the iniurye. He broughte the cauſe before them, to whom it pertained to knowe it: He complained not to <hi>Ammorhites</hi> or <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> but to his owne people. Wherfore he ordreth his accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſation well and lawfully: neyther by accuſing doth he violate the law,<note place="margin">By accuſinge the law is not violated, but holpen.</note> yea rather he is an help vnto it, as on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſide, they which hold their peace and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not wicked acts, ar againſt the lawes. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as of our ſelues we ought not to wiſh any mans death, ſo muſt we not ſuffer the lawes to be openly and vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly violated with out puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.<note place="margin">This ciuil war is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto the Leuite.</note> Wherefore let the biſhops in the old time looke howe godly they did, when they made interceſſion vnto magiſtrates for wicked men, and for ſuch as wer appointed to dy. If thou wilt ſay ther ſtraight way followed moſt ciuil warre, whiche thing ſeemeth may be imputed vnto the <hi>Leuite.</hi> But it is not ſo, it ought rather to be aſcribed vnto the <hi>Beniamits,</hi> which would not punyſhe ſo greate a wicked cryme.</p>
                  <p>In this hiſtory <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſomewhat varieth from the holy ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> Firſte he denieth that this woman was an adultreſſe, and that ſhe therefore departed from her huſband. She was (ſayth he) very beawtifull, and when her huſbande loued her excedingly, and complained that ſhe loued not him agayn, ſhe as one not able to abide his brawlinges, fled vnto her parents. But the holy ſcriptures do manifeſtly teache, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe had played the harlot. In which ſentence al the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters agree together. Farther he denieth that the <hi>Gabaonites</hi> thoughte this, namely to abuſe the <hi>Leuit,</hi> he ſayth that they being allured by the beawty of the wife, deſired onely to haue to do with her. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alſo is plainly againſt the holy ſcriptures, wherin it is by expreſſe words written: <hi>Bring forth the man, that we may know him.</hi> Farther he denieth that the <hi>Leuit</hi> deliuered his wife vnto them, but the <hi>Gabaonites</hi> (ſaith he) toke her by violence. At the laſt alſo he addeth this (which I thinke alſo is very likely) that the <hi>Leuite</hi> when he ſent the peces of the body, did ſende meſſengers alſo to declare what was done: otherwiſe he ſhoulde not much haue profited, if he had ſent but the peeces onely.</p>
                  <p>Theſe euils did therefore happen, bicauſe there was no magiſtrate or prince to iudge the Iſraelites.<note place="margin">In the papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal church ther is no magiſtrat</note> The ſame thinge alſo happeneth when there is a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat or prince, which doth not his office.

                  <p>THis place admoniſheth me to entreat of a magiſtrate, whome I iudge may thus be deſcribed, namely to be a perſon elected by the inſtitution of God, to kepe the lawes as touching outward diſcipline, in puniſhing tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſors with puniſhment of the body, and to nooriſh and defend the good.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:261"/> many perſons elected by the inſtitution of God which are not Magiſtrates as the miniſters of churches, whiche yet are keepers of the worde of God, &amp; of his law, but not as touching outwarde diſcipline onely. Bycauſe it is the office of miniſters, by the word of God to pearce eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the inward mocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of minds: for the holyghoſt adioyneth his power both to the right preachinges of his word &amp; alſo to the ſacraments which are diſtributed in the church. But the magiſtrat onely exerciſeth outward diſcipline &amp; puniſhment vpon tranſgreſſors. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter bindeth the guilty &amp; vnpenitent in the name of god, and in his name exclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth them from the kingdome of heauen, as long as they ſo remain. The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate puniſheth withoutward puniſhmentes, &amp; when nede requireth vſeth the ſword. Ether of them nouriſheth the godly, but after a diuerſe manner: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate encreaſeth them with riches, honors and dignities: the miniſter comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them with the promiſes of god, and with the Sacramentes. Wherefore the magiſtrate is inſtituted,<note place="margin">The end of a magiſtrate.</note> to the end that the lawes ſhould be moſt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly kept, the guilty puniſhed &amp; the good holpen &amp; nooriſhed. And vndoubtedly the law is a dumme magiſtrate, &amp; againe the magiſtrate is a liuing and ſpeaking law, and ſo alſo is the miniſter of god (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth) to theyr prayſe which do well: and contrarily he beareth the ſword againſt the wicked, as gods reuenger &amp; iudge, neyther tende theſe thinges to any other end, then to the health of men.</p>

The law of god alſo commaundeth to obey Magiſtrates. And before the law geuen by <hi>Moſes</hi> (as it is written in <hi>Gen.</hi>) god ordeined y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which ſhedeth mans blood his blood, alſo ſhould be ſhed, not vndoubtedly raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; by euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for that were very abſurd) wherefore we may gather by thoſe wordes, that a magiſtrate was not obſcurely inſtituted by god, whiche ſhoulde puniſh manquellers. <hi>Paule</hi> alſo writeth, that all powers whatſoeuer they be ar ordeined of god. And Chriſt aunſwered vnto <hi>Pilate:</hi> Thou ſhouldeſt haue no po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer againſt me, except it had beene geuen thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue. By theſe teſtimonies and reaſons it followeth that god is the true &amp; proper cauſe of Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>But here ſome cauell, &amp; ſaye that if all magiſtrates are of God, then muſt all things be rightly gouerned: but in gouerning publike welthes many things as we ſe, are done viciouſly &amp; peruerſly. Vndoubtedly vnder <hi>Nero, Domician, Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modus, Caracalla,</hi> &amp; <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> good lawes were conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, good men killed, &amp; diſcipline of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city was vtterly corrupted. But if Magiſtrates were of god, ſuch thinges coulde neuer haue happened. This reaſon neither can nor oughte any thing to moue vs: bicauſe the office is to be ſeperated from the perſon:<note place="margin">The office is to be ſeperated from the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> &amp; vndoub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedly it is poſſible, that he which hath the office may be a wicked &amp; noghty ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when as yet neuertheleſſe the power is good &amp; very profitable. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo good, but that men by theyr malice may vſe it ill. Therfore it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaile if there haue bene kings &amp; Emperors, which ſometimes haue abuſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer geuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which yet they were not ſo able to corrupt, but that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiued by it many good things &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>odities, as I haue before ſhewed. By the teſtimony of <hi>Daniell</hi> it is moſt manifeſt that Magiſtrates ar of God. For he (ſaith he) ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp; tranſferreth kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as it pleaſeth him. Farther we ſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monarche hath ſomtimes bene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt, ſomtimes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> South, afterwarde in the Weaſt, &amp; ſomtimes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North: &amp; alſo that there hath ſometimes bene good princes, and ſomtimes euill: ſometimes haue reigned noble men, &amp; ſometimes obſcure men. And we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it oftentimes happeneth that riches or power profite not to get or kepe a kingdome: and to thinke that theſe things are done by chaunce without the prouidence of God, it is moſt abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Some Aſtronomer will peraduenture ſay that theſe chaunges or mutacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are imported by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtarres: but <hi>Daniell</hi> the miniſter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, ſaith that it is God which chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth times.

He did caſt down <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; he alſo promoted <hi>Dauid.</hi> And he foretold that he woulde ſo do: leaſt it ſhould ſeme to haue happened raſhely or by chaunſe. Yea and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp; publike wealthes may be called certayne worke houſes or ſhops of the wil of god. For that is done in them, which god himſelf hath decreed to be done, although princes ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it not. God called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

For there are oftentimes ſo greiuous wicked actes and ſo many, that they cannot be corrected by the ordinary magiſtrate, and by a gentle and quiet gouernance of thinges, and therfore god doth then prouide tirannes to afflict the people, and yet for the moſt part he tempreth and lenyfieth his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in rayſinge vp good and godly princes.<note place="margin">God ſendeth good Princes after tirannes.</note> After the fall of <hi>Nero</hi> he ſet vp <hi>Veſpacian:</hi> after <hi>Domician,</hi> he ſent <hi>Neruan</hi> and <hi>Troian:</hi> after <hi>Commodus, Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> and <hi>Seuerus:</hi> after <hi>Heliogabalus, Alexander.</hi> But they which ſay: The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actes of Tirannes are not of God, yet do they range and ſpreade abroade in kingdomes and Empires, therfore Empires and kingdomes ar not of god: they (I ſaye) make a falſe <hi>Silogiſmus a ſecundum quid ad ſimpliciter</hi> that is, from that which appeareth to that which is indede, neither doth this rightly follow: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne thinges in a magiſtrate are not of God: therfore the magiſtrate is not of God.

                  <p>But it is a ſporte to beare the argumentes,<note place="margin">What the falſe eccleſiaſtical me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trifle of twoo ſwoordes.</note> whiche theſe falſe Eccleſiaſticall men vſe. In <hi>Etrauag. de Maioritate et Obedientia,</hi> chap. <hi>Vnam ſanctam, Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> the .viii. (whom they ſay entred in as a Foxe, raigned like a Lion, and dyed like a Dog) ſaith that there are two ſwordes in the Church. And leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to ſpeake it raſhly, he citeth theſe woordes out of the .xxii. chap. of <hi>Luke:</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſent you without bag or ſcrip, did ye at any time want any thing? They ſaid vnto him: No. Chriſt added: But now I ſaye vnto you, let euerye man take his ſcrippe and wallet, and he which hath none, let him ſell his coate and bye a ſwoord. They ſaid vnto him: Behold here are two ſwoordes. Chriſt anſwered, it is ſufficient. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> ſaith: Two ſwoordes are ſufficient for the Churche, namely the ſpiritual ſword and the temporal. Wherefore they whiche ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> had not an outward ſwoord, do ſeeme not to vnderſtand the woordes of Chriſt, wherein he ſayd: Put vp thy ſwoord into the ſheath. Thy ſwoorde (ſayth he) and not an other mans. For he had a ſwoord of his owne, although he were bidden to put it vp.</p>
                  <p>But there muſt needes be ſome order kept and obſerued in theſe ſwoordes. For what powers ſoeuer there be, they are ordained of God. For there ſhoulde be a great confuſion, if for that being two ſwordes in the Church, the one ſhould not be gouerned by the other. Wherfore the temporal ſword ought to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſpiritual. And to make this argument more plaine: The church (ſaith he) hath two ſwoordes, but it vſeth them not after one and the ſelfe ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For it exerciſeth the ſpiritual ſwoord, but the temporal ſword ought to be drawen, onely at the becke and ſuffrance of the Church. This is ſo obſcure, that it may in a maner ſeme to be a riddle. Howe be it this is his meaning,<note place="margin">The Pope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him ſelfe the ſwoorde of the Emperour.</note> that the ſworde of the Emperour ought to be drawen onely at the wyll and pleaſure of the Pope, that when he commaundeth, he muſt ſtrike, and by ſufferance, that is he muſt go forward in ſtriking, ſo long as he liſteth and wil ſuffer it. Wherfore theſe thinges muſt be in order: and the order is that the temporal ſwoord be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vnto God by the ſpiritual. For (as that <hi>Dioniſius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Dionyſius.</note> who is thought to be an <hi>Areopagite,</hi> although he be farre an other) all inferiour thinges are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the chiefeſt thing, but yet by a meane. Wherfore, ſaith he, the temporal ſworde muſt be drawen at the becke of the Pope, that by that meanes it may be referred vnto God. So we ſee is now brought to paſſe. For ſo often onelye as the moſt holy willeth that warre be made againſt the <hi>Lutherians,</hi> he wil that the Emperour ſtraightway ſhould obey. And if any Prince wil not with much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion obey him, ſtraightway are ſent Legates hither and thether, that al other kinges and princes ſhould apply them ſelues vnto his becke, and make war and vexe him, which wil not obey him.<note place="margin">The Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferreth himſelfe before al kings and princes.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bonifacius</hi> addeth moreouer that he himſelfe is aboue al kinges and princes. For principallity is to be eſteemed according to the dignity of the things which
<pb facs="tcp:18396:263"/> by it are exerciſed. We (ſaith he) exerciſe ſpiritual thinges, and they temporall, wherfore their ſwoorde is inferiour to ours, and they themſelues alſo vnto vs. He addeth alſo an other reaſon, they pay vnto vs tenthes, but tenthes ar paid by the inferior vnto the ſuperior. Wherfore ſeing kings &amp; princes pai tenthes, they do teſtify y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their lands &amp; reuenues pertaine vnto the church, &amp; that they ar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it. Moreouer, he which bleſſeth, is greater then he which is bleſſed. But Biſhops conſecrate and anoynt kinges. The Gloſe addeth: That of kinges one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the right ſhoulder is anointed, but the heades of Biſhops are anointed. And vpon Kinges is poured oyle, but vpon Biſhops <hi>Chriſma.</hi> Wherefore wee muſt needes confeſſe that Kinges are inferiour to Biſhops. Farther, kinges receaue the crowne and ſcepter of Biſhops. For who ſaith hee, anoynted <hi>Saul,</hi> and who anointed. <hi>Dauid,</hi> but onely <hi>Samuel?</hi> who anoynted <hi>Iehu,</hi> but a Prophet ſent by <hi>Helizeus?</hi> The matter alſo which is intreated of by biſhops, is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, about which kinges are occupied. For Chriſt ſaid vnto <hi>Peter:</hi> whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde in earth, ſhalbe bound in heauen. This power is greater then al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power. And God ſaith vnto <hi>Ieremy:</hi> I wil ſet thee ouer nacions and king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes, to roote out and deſtroy, to ſcatter and to plant. Therefore we are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then al the power of kinges, and are exempted from their right. Wherefore prophane and lay powers of Emperours and Kinges muſt be iudged by the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical men,<note place="margin">The Pope wil not bee iudged or gouerned of any.</note> &amp; ought by vs to be appointed, and may by vs be ouerthrowen. For to whom it pertaineth to builde, to the ſame it belongeth to deſtroy. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpiritual Magiſtrate ought to iudge of the ciuill Magiſtrate. But if the ſpiritual offende in any thing, of whom ought he to be iudged? The inferiour, ſaith he, ought to be iudged of the ſuperiour. But the Pope, which is the higheſt of al, of whom ſhal he be iudged? Of no man ſaith he, but onely of God, bycauſe the ſpiritual is iudged of no man, but he iudgeth al thinges.</p>
                  <p>Oh how finely and trymly ordaineth he his tirannye? He calleth hym ſelfe onely ſpiritual. The Gloſer, although he were otherwiſe groſe inough, yet hee could not be ſo much a blocke, but that he ſawe that theſe thinges were ſpoken very abſurdly. How, ſaith he, is the Pope ſpiritual, if he be vnpure and wycked? He expoundeth himſelfe by this diſtinction:<note place="margin">Two maner of ſpiritualties of the Canoniſts.</note> There is one maner of ſpiritualtye ſaith he, of the perſon, and an other of the ſtate. Wherfore if there be anye ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual perſon, he may reproue al men by a brotherly admonicion: but he ought to be reprehended of no man. Bicauſe for that he is ſpirituall, hee committeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing filthely. But ſometimes ſome perſon which is not ſpiritual in life and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners, ought yet to be called ſpiritual, bicauſe of his degree. As are many biſhops and Popes: wherfore we muſt cal the biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> whatſoeuer he be, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and moſt holy. But what thing els is this, then to teache vs to lye, if they wil haue a filthy varlet called moſt holye? <hi>Bonifacius</hi> at the laſt concludeth, that all Emperours and Kinges muſt be ſubiect vnto his power onely. And he addeth a reaſon: Vnles we wil together with the <hi>Maniches</hi> appoint twoo begynninges: which thing we ought not to do, for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd not, in the beginninges, but in the beginning God created heauen &amp; earth.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Before I come to confute this their moſt ſhameles boaſting, I thinke it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient briefly to ſpeake of the two maner of powers: of the Eccleſiaſticall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer I ſay, and ciuill. In that it is ſayd that the Eccleſiaſtical power is preferred before al ciuil functions, it is ſomwhat that they ſay, if it be rightlye and aptlye vnderſtand.

                     <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor raged to cruelly, and without al conſideracion againſt the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi>) perſwaded him, that in al puniſhmentes of death, ther ſhould be .xxx. daies ſpace after the ſentence geuen, leaſt the Magiſtrate ſhould do thoſe things in a rage and fury, wherof although he afterward repented him, yet they could not be amended. So many Biſhops, oftentimes in things moſt waighty, ſhewed foorth their authority, and many times either put away cruell warres, or els pacified them, &amp; out of the word of God preached among them. Wherfore the Eccleſiaſtical power after this maner comprehendeth althinges, bicauſe out of the woord of God it findeth how to geue counſell in all thinges. For there is nothing in the whole world, wherunto the woord of God extendeth not it ſelfe. Wherfore they are farre deceaued, which vſe to cry:<note place="margin">The preaching of the woord of God hath al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; al ſtates ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it.</note> what hath a Preacher to do with the publike wealth, what hath he to doo with warres? what with Potica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? what with Cookes? But let them tel me, when the Miniſter of the woorde perceiueth the law of God to be violated in theſe thinges, why ſhould he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende them by the woord of God? Why ſhould he not admoniſh them? Why ſhould he not exhort them to ceaſe from ſynne?<note place="margin">The Miniſter of the Churche worketh by the woord, and not by the ſwoord. How far cyuill power exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth</note> Nndoubtedlye it is his dutye to correct ſynners, not in dede with the ſwoord, or puniſhing by the purſſe, not by empriſonment, not by baniſhment, but after his owne manner, that is by the might and power of the woord of God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the political power is extended to al thoſe thinges which pertayne to political power. But after what maner? Shal ciuil power require good mocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the minde, and inward repentance? It cannot cauſe theſe thinges: yet it muſt wiſh theſe thinges, and vſe thoſe meanes wherby they may be had. For he ought to haue a care, that Biſhops, Paſtors and Teachers in the Churche doo teache purely, reprehende fatherly, and by the woord of God adminiſter the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. This thing in dede the Magiſtrate doth not by himſelfe, but hee ought to haue a regarde, that they may be in a redynes, which ſhould do them wel. Wherefore either power extendeth moſt amply, and comprehendeth al thinges, but not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one and the ſelfe ſame maner. And the rule of either of them is to bee taken out of the woord of God, which is plaine to be in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there are two ſubiections: One is political and ciuil,<note place="margin">Two kinds of ſubiection.</note> whereunto all men are ſubiect, who if they offend in any thing againſt the lawes, let them at the iuſt Magiſtrates hand looke for impryſonment, puniſhment by the purſſe, baniſhment, death, and outward paines. But if they doo wel, let them looke for honours, rewardes, dignities, and prayſe. And after this maner the ciuil power is not ſubiect vnto the miniſtery of the woorde, bicauſe by it it can not by theſe kindes of puniſhmentes be afflicted and conſtrained. The other ſubiection is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritual, that is of faith, and of obedience. For ſtrayghtway, as ſone as men heare of their duty out of the woord of God, and that either this thing or that is to bee done, or this or that thing to be auoyded, they geue place, beleue, and obey. By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they perceaue, that that which is ſpoken, is the woorde of God. And theſe are the endes of eyther power.<note place="margin">A ſentence of Valentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour.</note> And ſo is to be vnderſtand that ſaying of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> the Emperour, out of the booke called <hi>Hiſtoria Tripartita,</hi> which thing is had alſo in the diſtinction .63. chap. <hi>Valentinianus:</hi> Chuſe (ſaith he) ſuche a biſhop, vnto whom we which gouerne the Empire, may ſincerely ſubmyt our heades, and vſe his admonicions as medicines. &amp;c. By which wordes is vnderſtand that it longeth vnto the Eccleſiaſtical power,<note place="margin">An error of the ſame Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</note> to admoniſh out of the woorde of God for ſaluacion. Although the ſame Emperour afterward erred. For when he had appointed <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Pretor of the City of <hi>Millane,</hi> the people did chuſe him by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Which thing when the Emperor knew,<note place="margin">A biſhop ought not to haue a care onely ouer ſoules, or onely ouer bodyes.</note> he gaue thankes vnto God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after this maner: I had made hym ruler ouer the bodyes of men, but thou wouldeſt haue him ruler ouer the ſoules. &amp;c. <hi>Valentinian</hi> did not rightlye put a diſtinction betwene offices. For why? Ought biſhops to haue a care onely ouer ſoules, and not alſo ouer bodies? What if they geue them ſelues to glotonye or
<pb facs="tcp:18396:264"/> dronkennes, or liue licenciouſlye touching outwarde thinges, ſhall they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue theſe thinges? Vndoubtedly they muſt reproue them. Neither muſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue a care onely ouer the bodies of men, and neglect their ſoules. For wee do not imagine that a prince is a neateherd or a ſwineherd, to whom is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely the care of the belly, fleſh and ſkinne of his ſubiectes: yea he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that they may liue vertuouſly and godlily. But what if Chriſtian Princes when they are by the woorde of God admoniſhed of publike and moſt grieuous ſynnes, wil not heare, neither amende that which they haue noughtely commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted. What I ſay ſhal the biſhop do herein? <hi>Ambroſe</hi> excommunicated <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Emperor, when he exerciſed ſo grieuous tiranny againſt the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Innocentius</hi> alſo excommunicated <hi>Arcadius,</hi> when he had exiled <hi>Iohn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> who admoniſhed him freely and trulye, as it is had in the diſt. 96. chap. <hi>Duo ſunt,</hi> &amp; in the diſt. 18. in the chap. <hi>Quoniam quidam.</hi> And they are the wordes of the ſyxt Synode, where it is decreed that ther ſhould euery yeare be had two Sinodes. And if princes would hinder them, let them be excommunicated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Euſebius.</note>But what do I make mencion of theſe latter thinges? Let vs reade <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his .vi. booke, and .xxxiiii. chap. where he ſaith that <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperor, who liued in the tyme of <hi>Origene,</hi> was the firſt Chriſtian prince, and when he would haue bene preſent together with the faithful on Eaſter euen, and haue commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with them in prayers, the biſhop, bicauſe he was a wicked and nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty liuer, reiected him among them that wer put to penance, that he ſhould make open confeſſion before the Churche, and acknowledge his ſynne, otherwyſe hee could by no meanes be admitted vnto the Communion. This did the byſhop at that tyme againſt the Emperour &amp; chiefe Monarche of the whole world. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ciuil power ought to be ſubiect vnto the woorde of God which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Miniſters. But againe the Eccleſiaſticall power is ſubiect vnto the ciuil, when the Miniſters behaue themſelues yll, either in thinges humane or Eccleſiaſtical. For theſe powers are after a ſorte conuertible and ſundry wayes are occupied about the ſelfe ſame thinges, and mutually helpe one an other, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as <hi>Ariſtotle Theodectes</hi> calleth Rhethorike and Logike interchangeable artes,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> bicauſe either of them are occupied in the ſelfe ſame thinges after a ſundry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Eccleſiaſtical power is ſubiect vnto the Magiſtrate: not by a ſpiritual ſubiection, but by a politike. For as touching the Sacramentes and ſermons, it is not ſubiect vnto it, bicauſe the Magiſtrate cannot bende the woord of God or the Sacramentes, which the miniſtery vſeth, neither can he compel the paſtors and Teachers of the Church to teach otherwiſe, or in any other ſorte to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacramentes, then is preſcribed by the woorde of God. Howbeit mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in that they are men and Citizens, are without all doubte ſubiect vnto the Magiſtrate, and alſo their lands, riches, and poſſeſſions. So Chriſt payd tribute, ſo alſo did the Apoſtles, and the whole primatiue Churche, when there were yet moſt holye men. Their manners alſo are ſubiect vnto the cenſures and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Farthermore, we muſt adde that Miniſters are ſubiect vnto the Magiſtrate, not onely as touching thoſe thinges which I haue rehearſed, but alſo (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſignified) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their function. Bicauſe if they teache not right, neither adminiſter the Sacramentes orderly, it is the office of the Magiſtrate to compel them to an order, and to ſee that they teache not vnpurelye, and that they myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle not fables,<note place="margin">Princes may put Miniſters oute of their place, if their be haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues yll.</note> or that they abuſe not the Sacramentes, or delyuer them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the Lorde hath commaunded. Alſo if they liue noughtelye and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, let them put them out of the holy miniſterye. This did <hi>Salomon,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and ſubſtituted <hi>Sadok</hi> in his roume, as it is written in the fyrſt boke of Kinges, the ſecond chap. And in the new Teſtament, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> diſplaced <hi>Siluerius</hi> &amp; <hi>Vigilius,</hi> which thing I doubt not but other princes did ſometimes. But how iuſtly, I wil not preſently declare: this one thing I wil ſay, that that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18396:264"/> thing was lawful for them in the cauſes now alledged. But ſome man wil ſay, that I ſpeake now of the fact, and not of the right. Yea but I ſpeake alſo of the right. For the king ought to haue with him the law of God written, bicauſe he is ordained a keeper, not onely of the firſt table, but alſo of the latter.<note place="margin">It longeth not to the Miniſter of the Churche to put downe Princes.</note> Wherfore he which offendeth in any of them both, falleth into his power. But althoughe a king may remoue an vnprofitable and hurtful biſhop, yet can not a biſhop on the other ſyde put downe a king, if he offend. <hi>Iohn</hi> in dede reproued <hi>Herode,</hi> but he diſplaced him not of his kingdome. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> excommunicated Emperours: but they went no farther. Yea and Chriſt called <hi>Herode</hi> a woolfe, but he tooke not away from hym his kingdom, and he payed tribute vnto <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> a moſt wicked Tiranne, neither was he at any time author to any man to ſhake of his yoke. Wherefore let Popes take heede by what right as they luſt them ſelues, they put Kinges and Emperors out of their place. This thing did neither anye of the Prophetes, nor the Apoſtles, nor Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Popes boaſt that they haue great power: but if it be any that they haue, it conſiſteth wholy in the woord of God. Let them teache, preach, and admoniſh, if they wil exerciſe their power: otherwiſe the ciuil and temporal power, whom they ſo much crake of, is farre from the eccleſiaſtical Miniſters. In ſumme, euen as there is found no king nor Emperour ſo great, which is not ſubiect vnto the power of the woord of God, which is preached by the Miniſters: ſo on the other ſyde is there no biſhop, which when he hath offended, ought not to be reproued by the ciuil Magiſtrate. What difference ſo euer there bee, the ſame (as I haue ſayde) is wholye as touching the manner of reprouing. The Miniſters of the Churche doo that by the woorde, and Princes by outward puniſhmentes. But our falſe eccleſiaſtical men wilbe princes and raigne. But Chriſt woulde be no king. And when he was ſought for, to that ende to be made a king, he vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſed it: yea he openlye profeſſed that his kingdome was not of this worlde. He ſaid alſo vnto the Apoſtles: Princes of the nacions do beare rule ouer them, but ye ſhal not do ſo. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo (whoſe ſucceſſors they affirme them ſelues to be) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth Miniſters, not to exerciſe dominion ouer the Clergy. But theſe men wyll haue pryſons, ſoldiours and ſwoordes, and ſtyrre vp warres, as they luſt them ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Perduenture they wil obiect vnto vs the <hi>Aſſamonites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Aſſamo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nites or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites.</note> out of the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, whom it is certayne that they were both Kynges and Prieſtes, and confounded both the powers. That hiſtorye in deede is wrytten in the bookes of the <hi>Machabites,</hi> but we muſt ſee whyther they dyd it rightly, or wyckedly and ambiciouſly. Vndoubtedly I thinke they did it not orderly: for God by his word had many tymes adiudged the kyngdome vnto the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> euen to the tyme of <hi>Meſsias.</hi> And contrarily he commaunded the <hi>Leuites,</hi> that they ſhoulde poſſeſſe no landes, and muche leſſe to occupye a kyngdome among theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. But if a man had rather ſaye, that they did thys thyng by a certayne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete reuelacion and hydden iudgement of GOD, hee ſhall not amende theyr cauſe. For that whithe is ſo done, ought not to bee drawen into an example. But I thynke rather that they offended in ſo doyng. They dyd well vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlye, when they delyuered theyr Countrey from tyrranny: but that thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, they ought not to haue taken vpon them the kyngdome. Neyther dyd GOD obſcurely declare that that theyr act diſpleaſed hym. For (as wee gather out of <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) that houſe afterward neuer wanted Tragedies.<note place="margin">How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſomtimes vſed outwarde puniſhmentes.</note> They farther obiecte vnto vs, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſlewe <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and that <hi>Paule</hi> ſtrake <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer wyth blindnes. That is true in deede: but they dyd theſe thinges by the woorde of God, not by violence, not by the ſwoord, neither by the labour of a hangman. Let theſe men doo the ſame thynges by the woord, and wee wyll regarde them. Why doo they not harken vnto <hi>Paule</hi> to <hi>Timothe:</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18396:265"/> Let no man going on warfare for God, wrap hymſelfe in cares of this lyfe. If they wil go on warfare for God, why doo they in ſuch ſorte hynder themſelues with worldly buſines? Haue they ſo much leaſure from their own affaires, that they can haue a care ouer other mens thinges? Let them anſwer plainly: would they at this day abide, that any king ſhould attempt to teache the Goſpel, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacramentes? They would not ſuffer it. Neyther did God hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo ſuffer it:<note place="margin">The offices of both the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt not be confounded.</note> but he ſtrake <hi>Ozeas</hi> with Leproſy, when he would haue burnt inſence vnto God. Why therfore doo they inuade other mens borders? Theſe functions ought to be ſeperated, bicauſe either of them requireth a whole man a part by hym ſelfe: yea rather ſcarce hath beene founde anye one man at anye tyme, which coulde ryghtlye execute eyther of them, ſo hard a thyng is the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them both. Howbeit, both of them doo helpe one an other: for the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Prince geueth iudgement, and the Eccleſiaſticall doth not in deede geue iudgement, but he teacheth how iudgement ought to bee geuen. Haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect (ſayth he) of perſons in iudgement: afflict not the poore and ſtraunger: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no bribes. &amp;c. So on the other ſyde the political Magiſtrate preacheth not, neither adminiſtreth the Sacramentes. But vnleſſe theſe thinges bee ryghtlye ordered, he ought to puniſh the Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wherin either power differeth and agreeth.</note>And to be briefe, there are two thinges to be conſidered of vs in thys collaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the Ciuyll Magiſtrate is to be conſidered both the power, and alſo the man which beareth and exerciſeth the power. He in reſpect that he is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, is vndoubtedly ſubiect vnto the woorde of God, and in reſpect that hee beareth power, and gouerneth, he ought alſo to be ſubiect vnto the ſame woord of God. For out of it ought he to ſeeke rules to gouerne and to adminiſter. In the Miniſter of the Churche alſo is to be conſidered both the miniſterye it ſelfe, and alſo the perſon which executeth it. As touching the perſon, the miniſter is ſubiect vnto the Ciuill power: for he is both a Citizen, and payeth tribute as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men doo, and is vnder the correction of manners. But as concernyng the miniſterye, he is alſo ſomewaye ſubiect vnto the Magiſtrate: For if he eyther teache or adminiſter the Sacramentes agaynſt the woorde of God, he muſt bee reprehended by the Ciuil Magiſtrate. And yet muſt hee not ſeeke for rules and reaſons of hys function at the ſame Magiſtrates hand, but out of the woorde of God. By thys diſtinction we may eaſelye vnderſtande the differences and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eyther power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface.</note>Now reſteth to come to that <hi>Thraſo Bonifacius</hi> to confute hys argumentes. Fyrſt, he gathered out of that whych the Apoſtles anſwered: Beholde here are two ſwoordes, and Chriſt added: It is ſufficient, that the Churche hath twoo powers,<note place="margin">How the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che maye haue twſſiwoordes.</note> and both of them committed vnto hym. To that I aunſwer, that it is poſſible, that ſometymes there may be two ſwoordes in the Churche: but there were not ſo alwayes in it, neyther peraduenture ſhall bee alwayes ſo. What outward ſwoord had the Church in the tyme of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles and Martyrs?<note place="margin">The Churche hath nowe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt al artes.</note> But yet now (they wyll ſay) it hath. I graunt that, bycauſe kynges and Emperours are Chriſtians, whych in the olde tyme were Ethnikes. The Churche hath alſo huſbandrye, trade of marchaundiſe, the arte of Carpenters, and other ſuche lyke. For they whyche exerciſe theſe thynges, are members of the Church. But that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe (as the Schoolemen ſpeake) <hi>per accidens,</hi> that is by chaunce. For there might be a Churche, thoughe thoſe thynges were not. So nowe, bycauſe there are Princes in the Churche, it is ſayde to haue an outward ſwoorde. But bycauſe Princes are in our tyme a part of the Churche, it doth not therfore follow that the ſword of Princes is the ſword of miniſters: euen as although there be in the Church huſbandry and trade of merchaundiſe, and alſo the arte of Carpenters, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not therby be gathered that miniſters are huſband men, merchauntes, and Carpenters.</p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:18396:265"/>
                  <p>Now I come to the place of the Euangeliſt. The Apoſtles ſayde, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing, when they were ſent without wallet and ſcryp, vnto whom Chriſt ſayd: Let euery one take vnto him his ſcrip and wallet, and he which hath none, let him ſell his coate, and bye a ſwoord. What woulde Chriſte ſignifye by theſe woordes? Nothing els vndoubtedly, but to ſhewe that the ſtate and condicion of tymes hereafter ſhould be far otherwiſe then they wer before. Hitherto (ſayth he) whyleſt I was wyth you, ye felt no griefe, neyther wanted you any thyng. But now harder tymes are at hand: now ſhall ye haue neede of coates, ſcryps, and ſwoordes. By theſe woordes hee declareth that hee ſhoulde depart from them, and that hee woulde ſende them into the whole worlde to preache and teache the Goſpell, in which miniſtery they ſhould meete with ſo manye aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, that they ſhould thinke themſelues to haue neede of ſwoordes. It is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue kinde of ſpeeche, whereby is vnderſtande one thing by an other, as is that in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when the Lorde ſayde, that hee repented that he had made man. For God is not in very deede touched with repentance, but he doth that, which men repenting vſe to doo, that is, he chaungeth that which hee hath done. And vndoubtedly then he by the flood deſtroyed humane kinde which hee had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So now he hath not inſtructed his Diſciples, to fight with yron, but onelye by a certaine paraphraſis deſcribeth the condicion of the tyme to come. And euen as a gowne oftentimes ſignifieth tranquility and peace: ſo in this place a ſword ſheweth troubleſome and vnquiet times.</p>
                  <p>After this maner <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> interpreteth theſe woordes,<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> expounding this place of <hi>Paule:</hi> Salute <hi>Priſca</hi> and <hi>Aquila.</hi> The Lorde (ſayth he) hath not broken the lawe, which before he had made, ſaying: And hee which ſtriketh thee on the one cheeke, turne vnto him the other. Bleſſe thoſe that curſe you, pray for them that perſecute you. How then doth he commaunde his Diſciples to bye themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſwoordes? He ment no ſuch thing, ſaith <hi>Chriſoſtome:</hi> For it is a figuratiue kinde of ſpeeche, whereby he ſignified that he ſhould be taken away from them, and that they ſhould be afflicted with many calamities. Theſe woordes are not ſo to be taken as they appeare at the firſt ſyght. In an other place Chriſte ſayth alſo: That which ye haue heard in the eare, preache on the houſe toppes. And yet wee neuer reade, that the Apoſtles ſtoode on the houſe toppes, when they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto the people. Neither aſſuredly was it decent to haue left the ſtrete and temple, and to haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the houſe top. The ſenſe was, that thoſe thinges which they had hearde priuatelye, they ſhoulde ſpeake openlye and manifeſtlye. The Lord alſo ſayd: Deſtroye this temple, and in three dayes I wyll reſtore it: which is alſo ſpoken figuratiuely. For he commaunded not to ouerthrowe the temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> (as the Euangeliſt himſelfe interpreteth) but vnderſtoode that which he ſpake, of the temple of hys owne body: wherein (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth) corporally dwelled all diuinity.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to the matter, that <hi>Luke</hi> ſo ment <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> proueth by theſe thinges which follow: That in the ſonne of man ſhoulde be fulfylled that which was ſpoken of him: And he was counted with the vngodly. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles vnderſtoode not Chriſt: for they thought that hee had ſpoken ſimplye, and (as the woordes ſounded) ſpoken of an outward ſword. And ſo did <hi>Boniface</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly interpreate it. And in that Chriſt addeth: It is inough, he vnderſtoode that two ſwordes are ſufficient in the Church, ſo that ther ought to be nowe neyther more nor fewer. But <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vnderſtandeth it farre otherwiſe. For when Chriſt perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtles vnderſtode him not, by that anſwer he declared that he would omit the thing. And in dede ſo is a ſcholemaſter wont to ſay vnto a child which yet vnderſtandeth not that which is taught him: It is inough. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vndoubtedly two ſwords wer not ſufficient againſt al the aduerſaries of Chriſte. There ſhoulde moreouer haue needed coates of male and ſhieldes. Wherfore <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> concludeth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpeche was figuratiue &amp; parabolical.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:266"/> Farthermore,<note place="margin">In the times of the Apoſtles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church had not two ſwoordes.</note> if <hi>Bonifacius</hi> expoſition bee receaued, wee muſte thincke that the Church in the time of the Apoſtles ought to haue had two ſwords, which is moſt farre from the truth.</p>
                  <p>But let vs come to that which Chriſt ſaid vnto <hi>Peter:</hi> Put vp thy ſwoord into thy ſheath. Thy ſword (ſaith <hi>Boniface</hi>) not an other mans ſword. But what ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thereth he by thoſe wordes? Although <hi>Peter</hi> haue his ſword, yet if he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to put it vp, how can he haue it drawen? or to what end hath he a ſwoord, if he maye not vſe it? But <hi>Boniface</hi> wil peraduenture aunſwer: I haue in deede a ſword, but I vſe it not, but by an other mans hande. Or I vſe not myne owne ſwoord, but the ſword of the Emperor, &amp; other princes. For they ought to draw the ſword at the becke and ſufferance of the Church. I would gladly demaund, whither Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bad <hi>Peter</hi> to put vp his ſword, ment this, that he ſhould in dede vſe it as he liſted and would himſelfe,<note place="margin">Euery man is ſayd to doo that himſelfe whych he doth by an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther man.</note> but yet by the labour of an other man? Aſſuredly that which a man doth by an other, he ſeemeth to do it himſelfe. If a man by mony or giftes get one to kil his enemy, although he do it not with his own hand, yet neuertheles he ſhould be an homicide: otherwiſe euen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doth not with their own hand kil the guilty, but commaunde the hangmen to puniſh them. Ther is in this anſwer of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> a deceite of equiuocation. For we demaund whither an eccleſiaſtical Miniſter may beare the office of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil Magiſtrate, and vſe a ciuil ſword: and they remit vs vnto the ſword of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a man otherwiſe priuate.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Bernardus.</note>Howbeit <hi>Bernardus</hi> in his .4. booke <hi>de Conſider. ad Eugenium,</hi> ſemeth to inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prete the two ſwordes. I graunt that <hi>Bernard</hi> hath certaine thinges lyke vnto this, but yet not vtterly the ſame. But we muſt remember, in what tyme <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus</hi> lyued. He liued at that time, wherein all thinges were corrupted in the Church, and if a man reade thoſe his bokes <hi>de Conſideratione,</hi> he ſhal ſe that he grieuouſly complaineth of the corruption of his time. <hi>Eugenius</hi> was by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> excluded the City, and peraduenture he meditated by violence to reſtore himſelfe. Wherefore <hi>Bernard</hi> exhorted them to preache the Goſpell, to deale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> with the woorde and with Sermons, rather then wyth the ſword. <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſaid: what wilt thou haue? That I ſhould feede Serpentes and Dragons and Beaſtes? Yea rather aſſayle them ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> with the woord, &amp; not with iron. And in an other place he ſaith: If thou wilt haue both ſwordes, thou ſhalt leeſe both. Neither is it to be thought that <hi>Eugenius</hi> would by himſelf haue fought, but peraduenture he aſſayed to moue warre by other, from whiche purpoſe <hi>Bernard</hi> diſſwaded him. And thus much of him.</p>
                  <p>But in that <hi>Bonifacius</hi> addeth, that thoſe ſwords of the church ought to be in order (namely that the one ſhould be ſubiect vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, &amp; that he proueth by thys ſaying of <hi>Paule:</hi> Thoſe powers that are, are ordeined of God) is manifeſtly declared how this man wreſteth the ſcriptures. For this word <hi>ordinatae,</hi> that is ordered, is in Greeke written <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: which is nothing els, then inſtituted or appointed. But be it ſo, as <hi>Bonifacius</hi> hath expounded it, what manner of order ſhal this be at the length? Vndoubtedly, it ſhoulde be that the Miniſter ſhoulde teache, and the ciuil power ſhoulde heare and beleue. But this is nothing vnto the Pope which teacheth nothing.</p>
                  <p>The loweſt thinges ſaith <hi>Dioniſius</hi> are by meanes reduced vnto the hygheſt. Wherfore <hi>Bonifacius</hi> concludeth that the outward ſword ought to be referred vnto God by the ſpiritual. Vndoubtedly I wil eaſely graunt that the ſwoord of the ſpirit, that is the word of God, is the meane wherby the other ſword, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the outwarde, ought to be tempered and directed vnto God.

And when the prieſtes abuſed the mony which was offred for the men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of the couerings of the temple, who remedied that, but onely <hi>Ioas</hi> the king? I will not ſpeake of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and others which deuided the lottes of the prieſt, &amp; orders of the <hi>Leuites.</hi> And I will not at this time proue theſe things by any more examples.

                  <p>They boaſte moreouer that they themſelues are greater in dignitye, for that they excerciſe ſpirituall &amp; heauenly thinges, where as princes are occupied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about earthly and ciuill thinges. Be it ſo: for we deny not but that miniſters are occupied about thinges greater and more deuine then magiſtrates are. But doth the Pope alone miniſter them? Yea rather he neuer doth it at al. Wherfore if the dignity of the miniſtery depend of thoſe things, then will it follow that ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny biſhops and prieſtes do in dignity far excell the Pope, which neuer preacheth, &amp; moſt rarely, and to very few, adminiſtreth the Sacraments.</p>

                     <hi>Leuits</hi> was much inferior vnto the prieſthode of Chriſt. I haue opened the ſpring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence <hi>Bonifacius</hi> deriued his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The place is very dark, and nedeth explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and moreouer <hi>Bonifacius</hi> doth not aptly apply it to his purpoſe. Firſt we ought to vnderſtand that tenthes in the old time pertayned vnto ceremonies, &amp; that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel in <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> as in the <hi>Leuites.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Both the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hode of Leui &amp; alſo of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech ſignified Chriſt.</note> For in either prieſthode they were referred vnto Chriſt. And either prieſthode was in very dede a figure of Chriſt: for euen as the Leuiticall prieſte entred once euery yeare into the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> and that neuer without blood: So Chriſt by his blood entred once into the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that is into heauen, and agayne <hi>Melchiſedeche</hi> for that he had neyther father nor mother, reſembled Chriſt, which in reſpect that he was God, had no mother, and in reſpect that he was a man, wanted a father.</p>
                  <p>But what ſignified the tenthes in either prieſthode?<note place="margin">Chriſte was more playnelye ſignified by the prieſthode of Melchiſedech, then by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode.</note> Vndoubtedly they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing els, then that the elders ought to referre al theyr things vnto chriſt.

Ye do take them indede, but now that Chriſt is come, the paying of tenthes is no more a ceremony, as it was before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, when by te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thes men worſhipped Chriſt, which was to come in the fleſh, and confeſſed that they ought vnto him both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and al that they had.

But by what law? Not vndoub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedly by the ceremoniall law, but by the morall lawe. Foraſmuche as it is mete that the Myniſter ſhoulde bee nooryſhed of the people. For the laborer is woorthye of hys rewarde: and hee whyche ſerueth the Goſpel, it is meete
<pb facs="tcp:18396:267"/> that he liue of it. Wherfore whither ſtipéds be payd vnto miniſters out of lands or out of houſes, either in ready mony or in tenths, it ſkilleth not, ſo that they be not maintained filthily, but honeſtly. Indede theſe rewardes in ſome places doo retayn the olde name of tenthes. But in many places they ar not called tenthes, but ſtipendes or wages. And aſſuredly they are in very deede rather rewards, whiche are dew vnto the labours of the miniſters, then tenthes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Stipendes are paid both to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to inferiors.</note>And as touching this foreſayd argument, we muſt vnderſtand that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes and ſtipendes, are thinges indifferent: bicauſe they are ſometimes payd vnto inferiors, and ſometimes to ſuperiors. For tributes which are geuen vnto kinges and princes, are theyr ſtipendes which we geue vnto them, partly to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and ſuſteine them, and partly to confeſſe that we are ſubiecte vnto them, and laſtly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they may haue wherwithal to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the publike welth and vs. And ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inferiors alſo do receaue ſtipendes. For princes pay them vnto ſouldiers, and yet cannot we therefore ſaye that the ſouldiours are greater then Kynges and Prynces. And notwythſtandynge I woulde not haue anye thynke, that I ſpeake theſe thinges, to dimynyſhe the dygnitye of the Eccleſiaſticall miniſterye, but that men myghte vnderſtande that theyr argumentes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling.<note place="margin">The church which payeth the ſtipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto the miniſter is greater then he Why in the church kinges are conſecrated Power is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto princes of god, and not of biſhops.</note> Neither doubt I to affirme, that the church it ſelf whiche payeth the ſtipend vnto the miniſter, is greater then the miniſter. Wherfore if we ſpeake of tenthes, as they are at this day geuen vnto miniſters, they are no cauſe that they ſhould be greater then thoſe that pay them. But in that kinges and Emperors are conſecrated and annointed of byſhops, and in that they receiue the crowne and ſword of them, it nothinge helpeth their cauſe. For if we ſpeake of the ciuill power, that is not geuen of the biſhop, but of God. But this thing is ther done, that after the king or Emperor is choſen of god, in ſuch manner as is agreable, prayers ſhould be made for him in the aſſembly of the church, that god may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen his hart, that he may encreaſe piety in him, and inſtil in him a feare of his name, proſper his counſels, and ſo make fortunate his actions, that they may proue profitable vnto the church, and vnto the publike welth. And the biſhop whileſt theſe thinges are in doing, is the mouth of the church, &amp; goeth before it, in expreſſing the prayer. And this function was deriued of an olde cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and cuſtome of the Iewes. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the king receaueth not his power of the biſhop, but of God, euen their owne decrees alſo do teſtifye. In the <hi>diſt.</hi> 96. chap. <hi>Si Imperatur, Gelaſius</hi> ſaith, that the Emperor hath the priueleges of his power at gods hand. Why then doth <hi>Bonifacius</hi> arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly claim it vnto himſelf? name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that which longeth to God onely. For as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: All power is of god. In the Code <hi>de Iure veteri enucleando</hi> in the lawe firſte,<note place="margin">Iuſtiniane.</note> 
                     <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> declareth that his power was geuen him of the deuine maieſty.

                  <p>But let vs more narowly examine <hi>Bonifacius</hi> argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: I (ſayth he) do geue power vnto Emperors. Therfore I am greater then Emperors.

And if that follow not, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the argument al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> of no force, bicauſe (as I haue now ſhewed) it cleaueth vnto a bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken foundation. For they are not biſhops which geue power vnto kinges. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">All emperors were not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated of the Pope.</note> wer there not many Emperors whiche were neuer conſecrated of biſhops, and yet were neuertheles for al that Emperors?

Wherfore <hi>Bonifacius</hi> laboreth in vayne about his conſecration, bicauſe he canne
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18396:267"/> gather nothing thereby.</p>
                  <p>He boaſted moreouer of the kayes.<note place="margin">Wherin the kayes of the church conſyſt.</note> We (ſayth he) haue the power of binding and loſing. But the power of the kayes conſiſteth herein, that ye ſhould preach the word of god truly. For he which beleueth the goſpel, is loſed: &amp; he which bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth not, is bound. But when ye neither preach, nor teach, neither can ye binde, nor loſe. And farther this ſubiection which we haue graunted is ſpiritual, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly of fayth and of obedience: and not ciuill, and with dominion.</p>
                  <p>Afterward was <hi>Ieremy</hi> obiected, vnto whom the Lord ſayde: I haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee ouer nacions and kingdoms, &amp;c. Firſt here I demaund what kings <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> deiected, or whom he abrogated of theyr Empire, and what new kinges he inſtituted? They can ſhew of none. What therefore ſignify theſe woordes: I ſet thee ouer nacions and kingedomes? Vndoubtedly nothing els, then that by the ſprite of prophecy &amp; word of god he ſhould foretell what kingdomes god would ouerthrow for ſinnes, and what new ones he would inſtitute. Why doe not the Popes ſo excerciſe theyr power? Let them ſette before kinges and princes of the earth the threatninges of god,<note place="margin">Prophetes are not the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of kingdomes.

Could <hi>Ieremy</hi> be called the cauſe of the ouerthrowe of kingdomes? He was not properly the efficient cauſe, but onely a certayn occaſion. For when he had admoniſhed the king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and he beleued him not, the prophet by his preachinge was ſome occaſion that he ſhoulde be condemned and ouerthrowne. So <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: To ſome we are the ſauor of life to life, and to other the ſauor of death to death: When as yet the Apoſtle properlye killed no man, but his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after a ſorte broughte death vnto thoſe whiche would not beleue.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bonifacius</hi> goeth on, the lay power ought to be iudged of the Eccleſiaſticall, but by what kind of iudgement? Vndoubtedly by this, that in the churche he ſet forth the anger of God againſt ſinners, &amp; that they be admoniſhed and corrected by the holy ſcriptures. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops may expel kings and put them out of their kingdome, wher is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> permitted? Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence haue they that? what writings wil they bring for it?<note place="margin">The Pope ought to be iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged of the church.</note> But that is moſt intollerable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope ſayth that he can be iudged of no man. And yet <hi>Iohn</hi> .23. was in the counſel of <hi>Conſtance</hi> put downe, and not onely by god, but alſo by men. So theſe men plant and replant Canons, and the ſame they allow and diſalow, as often as they think good. Yea and Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perors haue ſometimes thruſt out and put down Popes, as it is before ſaid. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gal.</hi> ſayth: If an Aungell from heauen preach any other goſpel, let him be accurſed. If the Pope (which may come to paſſe, and hath alredy long ſince come to paſſe) obtrude wicked opinions, who ſhall pronounce him accurſed?<note place="margin">It is the dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to execut the ſentence of the church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the pope</note> Shall he be vtterly iudged of no man? The church vndoubtedly ſhal geue ſentence vpon him: and the magiſtrate (for that he is the chiefeſt part of the church) ſhal not one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly iudge together with it, but alſo ſhall execute the ſentence. Farther it longeth vnto the magiſtrate to prouide that the riches of the churche be not geuen vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies of godlines. Wherefore if biſhoppes become enemies of the churche, a faythfull magiſtrate ought not to ſuffer the goods of the church to be conſumed by them. The Canoniſts haue this oftentimes in theyr mouth: That for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſake is geuen the benefice. When therfore they do not their office, ought the magiſtrate to ſuffer them to enioy their benefices?</p>
                  <p>But let vs heare howe <hi>Bonifacius</hi> proueth that he can be iudged of no man. Bycauſe he that is ſpiritual (ſayth he) iudgeth all thinges, but he himſelfe is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of no man. A godly and wel applied argument I promiſe you. But let vs ſe what kind of iudgement <hi>Paul</hi> writeth of in that place. He ſpeaketh not vndoub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedly of the common kind of iudgement, whereby men are either put to death or put oute of theyr roome. He entreateth there onelye of the vnderſtandinge of thinges deuine, and which auaile vnto ſaluation. Theſe thinges I ſay properlye
<pb facs="tcp:18396:268"/> belong vnto the iudgement of the ſpiritual man: but concerning common iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and knowledge of ciuill cauſes, <hi>Paule</hi> neuer thoughte of them in that place. Which is eaſely perceaued by his wordes, we haue not receiued (ſaith he) the ſprite of this world: but a ſprite, which is of God. If thou wilt demaund for what vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprite is geuen vs: He anſwereth, that we ſhould know thoſe things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are geuen vs of God. And bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprite of this worlde cannot geue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of thinges deuine, it is added: The carnall man vnderſtandeth not thoſe things which ar of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprite of god. The ſpiritual man iudgeth al things. What? Doth he iudge alſo ciuill and common cauſes? No vndoubtedlye: but he iudgeth thoſe thinges whiche pertayne vnto the ſaluation of men: he himſelfe is iudged of no man. Without doubt both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were iudged by the ciuil power, wherunto <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to be iudged there, and yet were they both ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Peter &amp; Paule were iudged by the ciuil power.</note>But that place is thus to be vnderſtanded.

                  <p>When we obiecte vnto the papiſtes theſe wordes of <hi>Paule:</hi> let euery ſoule be ſubiect vnto the ſuperior powers, they aunſwere: that euery ſoul ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect vnto the ſuperior power, but yet to theyrs, not to other mens power, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the frenchmen ought to be ſubiect vnto the Spaniardes, the Spaniardes to the <hi>Germaines,</hi> which thing, for that it is abſurd, it is concluded, that euery man ought to obey his own Magiſtrat. But now the clergy acknowledge the biſhops for theyr power, and ought to be ſubiect vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and the biſhops acknowledge the Archbiſhoppes and Primates, and they laſtly acknowledge the Pope. After this manner ſay they, we obey the power, and ſatiſfye <hi>Paule.</hi> What haue we to do with kings or ciuil magiſtrats? But this is nothing els, then moſt filthily to abuſe the wordes of <hi>Paule.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Papiſtes do re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into two partes both the kingdomes and the people.</note> Doo they not ſee that they deuide the publike wealth into two bodies, which oughte to be one body onely?

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18396:268"/> And thereby commeth to paſſe, that the Clergy whiche are Frenchemen, ſeeme not to be Frenchemen: and the Germanes ſeeme not to be Germanes. And this maketh not coniunction, but diuiſion.</p>
                  <p>Farther, of what power I praye you ſpeaketh <hi>Paul?</hi> Not vndoubtedly of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Archebiſhops, but of that power whiche beareth the ſwoorde. He doth not without a cauſe (ſayth he) beare the ſwoorde. He ſpeaketh of that power to whom tribute is payd. For for this cauſe (ſayth he) ye pay tribute. But Biſhops neither beare ſwoorde, nor exacte tributes of the people. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of them. And thoughe Germany Byſhops beare the ſwoorde, and do gather tributes and cuſtomes, they doo not that in reſpect that they are Byſhops, but in reſpect that by accidens they haue the ciuile power adioyned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let them ſee to it. But it is manifeſt that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of the Ciuile power, vnto whiche he commaunded that euery ſoule ſhould obey. Neither is the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Origene</hi> probable, wherin he affirmeth, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd: Euery ſoule,<note place="margin">Origene.</note> and not euery ſpirite. Bycauſe (ſayth he) the ſpirituall man is moued with no affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, neither poſſeſſeth he any thyng in the world. Wherfore he is not ſubiect at all vnto the outward power. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> commaundeth euery ſoule, that is, euery carnall man to obey the ciuile power. But what? Was not Chriſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall? who was more ſpirituall? And yet he acknowledged the ſuperior power, and payd tribute. What ſay you to the Apoſtles, were not they ſpirituall? And yet they neuer exempted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from the ciuile power: yea rather they obeyed and taught others to obey them.</p>
                  <p>But let vs heare what our <hi>Bonifacianes</hi> aunſwere farther. They ſay that they haue not this power ordinarily, and by the right of their fruition, but graunted them by priuiledges and giftes of princes. And why ſay they is it not lawful for vs to enioye the priuiledges and liberality of princes? But we ought here to haue a regard, not what princes haue doone, but what they ought to haue done. God without all doubt hath made ſubiect euery ſoule vnto the hygher power. It was neuer lawfull for any prince to breake that law.<note place="margin">Whether it wer lawful for princes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtical men from their ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Nor humane reaſon ſeeth not better then the prouidence of God, what ſhould become of the affaires of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kynd. And the euent it ſelfe alſo ſufficiently hath declared how much that remiſſion of princes hath profited. For after that Biſhops and falſe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal men got themſelues once fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſubiection of the ciuile power, they ſtraight way became farre worſe then they were before, and made the people which were committed to theyr charge, nothyng the better.

                  <p>But what if a man clayme hymſelfe to be a Miniſter onely by hys apparell or garmentes, and doth nothyng in the Churche, is this freedome alſo graunted vnto hym?<note place="margin">Iuſtiniane.</note> No vndoubtedly.

                  <p>Yet the Pope in his Decretalles (<hi>de Immunitate Eccleſiae</hi> in the chapter. <hi>Non minus,</hi> where the woordes of the Counſell holden at <hi>Lateranum</hi> are cited.

This law as to cruel, <hi>Benedictus</hi> the .11. after a ſort mitigateth, in <hi>Extrauag. de Immunitate Eccleſ.</hi> in the chap. <hi>Quod olim,</hi> yet he permitteth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince to do any thyng without aſkyng counſel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Byſhop of Rome. For he in deede doth not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate thoſe princes which do receaue tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bute of Eccleſiaſticall men, but onely thoſe that exacte it of them. For he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not, that princes ſhould exacte any thyng by their owne right, whiche thing yet ſometymes he permitteth, namely in an extreme neceſſity, as in daunger of religion and lyfe, ſo that firſte there be had the conſent of the Byſhop and clergy, and afterwarde alſo the agreement of the Pope. So longe therefore hath he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that they muſt tary. So theſe men do exempt themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience and tributes of princes and kyngs, which (as I haue before ſayd out of <hi>Vlpiane</hi>)
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18396:269"/> are the eſtabliſhementes and ſinewes of the publique wealth.<note place="margin">A ſayinge of Diocletian.</note> When I thinke vpon theſe thinges, I call to remembraunce a profitable ſaying of <hi>Diocletian:</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when a Philoſopher deſired an immunite: This requeſt (ſayd he) diſagreeth with thy profeſſion. Thou profeſſeſt (ſayd he) that thou wilt ouercome thy affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but thou ſheweſt that thou art ouercome of auarice. So theſe men profeſſe themſelues to be ſpirituall. But in a ſpirituall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing more required the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charity, whiche counſelleth vs not to lyue franchiſed and ſecurely, when other are oppreſſed with cares and burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> bringeth a place of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> to ſhewe that Prieſtes are exempted from tributes,<note place="margin">Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nas.</note> not in deede by the law of GOD, but by a lawe made by princes, and yet neuertheles agreing with the law of nature.

This place is diligently to be conſidred. Firſt let vs note, that the Prieſts of the Egyptians had theyr dayly lyuing out of the threaſory of the kyng. They had meate and drinke and money geuen them to lyue by. Afterward it came to paſſe, that when the hunger waxed great, all the Egyptians ſolde their landes vnto the kyng, therwith to buy corne to driue away the hunger. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that famine was paſt, the kyng rendred the landes vnto the olde poſſeſſors, but yet vpon this condition, that euery yeare they ſhould paye him the fift parte, but of the landes of the Prieſtes there was no fift part payd. And no meruayle: bycauſe they ſold not their landes vnto the king when they were kept of the common coſt. Yet it is to bee thought that they payd ſo muche tribute of their landes as they were wont to pay before the famine. Neither vndoubtedly can any other thyng be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of that place, but that Prieſtes ought to be nooriſhed of the common coſt: but in that they payed not the fift part, that happened for an other cauſe, as we haue nowe declared.</p>
                  <p>They bring forth alſo the .8. chapter of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> where <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> prouided that when he had layd a tribute vpon the Iewes, there ſhould be nothing leuied of the <hi>Leuites</hi> in the name of a tribute. But this is not to be meruayled at, ſeyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi> had no landes to pay tribute of. For vnto them pertayned onely oblations, firſt fruites, and tenthes.

The word of God hath otherwiſe commaunded, when it ſayth, let euery ſoule be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto the higher power. And therfore (ſayeth he) ye pay tributes.

                     <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon that place of <hi>Paul:</hi> It may (ſayth he) ſeeme greuous vnto Chriſtians, for that they beyng the children of God and appoynted for the kyngdome of heauen, are ſubiect vnto princes of this world.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:270"/> done of the ſaintes. Nowe that we are regenerate by the worde and the ſpirite, it might ſeeme that we neede no Magiſtrate.

The Clergy of the Pope alſo haue ſhaked of this yoke from themſelues. But the Apoſtles which foreſawe that this thing would come to paſſe, did very often inculcate, that the Ciuile power ſhould be obeyed, whiche precept is two wayes tranſgreſſed: one way is, when men ſay they will not obey the Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">Sinne commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted two maner of wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrate.</note> and ſediciouſly make warre agaynſt hym. The other way is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they circumuent hym by ſubtility and guile, that he can not execute his office. For there are in courtes, whiche flatter in the eares of princes, diſprayſe &amp; prayſe whom they luſt, complayne of the good, as euill, and commend the euil, as good.

If a man ſhould obiect vnto them, this Temple is not yours, neither maketh it any matter vnto you what is here done: yea but they would then aunſwere, for as muche as it is in our City, in that it ſufficiently pertayneth vnto vs. But wicked actes, farre more grieuous then murthers and conſpiracyes, are there committed, Idolatry I ſay, ſacrilege,

And whiche is muche moſte grieuous of all, thoſe thynges are there ſuffred, where many yeares the Goſpell of Chriſte hath bene receaued.</p>
                  <p>Nowe reſteth (bycauſe oftentymes the Magiſtrate excuſeth hymſelfe, ſaying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eccleſiaſtical cauſes pertayne not vnto him) to declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be vntrue.

I adde that alſo whiche <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> that not onely priuate men, but alſo kynges ought to ſerue the Lorde. For in the Pſalme it is written: In gatheryng together peoples into one, and kynges to ſerue the Lorde. And in an other place. And nowe O kynges vnderſtand, be wiſe ye that iudge the earth. Serue the Lord in feare, &amp;c.

For he by his authority and power ought ſo to ſerue the Lorde, that he muſt puniſhe thoſe that are agaynſt hym: whiche thyng vnles he doo, he ſeemeth to aſſent vnto blaſphemers and heretikes. For the king, when he ſeeth theſe menne, and ſuffreth them, is as much in faulte, as if he ſhoulde ioyne hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with them, and mainteyne theyr wicked actes. <hi>Nebuchad-Nezar</hi> as ſoone as euer he knewe GOD, made a decree that whoſoeuer ſpake blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the GOD of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſhoulde dye.

The Ethnike Emperors alſo in thoſe firſt tymes did for no other cauſe rage agaynſt the Chriſtians, but bycauſe they thought that matters of religion pertayned vnto their iudgement ſeat.

And when by hym they were ouercome, they appealed agayne vnto the Emperor, neyther reiected he their appealation from him, but committed the matter vnto the Biſhop of <hi>Orleance:</hi> by whom they were agayne condemned.

                     <note place="margin">Iuſtinian. Auguſtine.</note> wrote many Eccleſiaſticall lawes of Byſhoppes and Prieſtes, and other ſuch lyke. Yea and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath taught, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought after the ſame manner to puniſh Idolatrers &amp; heretikes, as he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth adulterers, for as much as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte whoredome againſt God in mynd: which is much more heynous then to committe whoredome in body. And looke by what lawe murtherers are put to death, by the ſame alſo Idolatrers and heretikes ought to be puniſhed, for that by them are killed not the bodies, but the ſoules: although the common people be ſtirred vp onely agaynſt homicides, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee the bloud of the bodyes killed, but ſee not the death of the ſoules. Vndoubtedly it is profitable for the Magiſtrate to take vpon hym this care, and by his authority to compell menne to come to holy ſermons, and to heare the worde of God: for by that meanes it commeth to paſſe, that by often hearyng thoſe thyngs, begyn to pleaſe, whiche before diſpleaſed. As Hyſtoryes teach, that God hath oftentymes with moſt noble victoryes illuſtrate godly prynces,<note place="margin">God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered princes whiche had a care vnto Reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion.</note> which haue had a care vnto theſe thinges.</p>
                  <p>Farther, it can not be denied, but that it is the dewty of the Magiſtrates to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe Cities and publique wealthes ouer whiche they are gouerners, and to prouide that no hurt happen vnto them: wherfore for aſmuch as Idolatry is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of captiuity, peſtilence, famine, &amp; ouerthrowing of publique wealthes, ſhal it not pertaine vnto the Magiſtrate to repreſſe it, and to kepe the true ſound reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Laſtly <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth fathers to inſtruct their children in diſcipline, &amp; in the feare of God: but a good Magiſtrate is a father of the countrey, wherfore by the rule of the Apoſtle he ought to prouide that ſubiectes be inſtructed as common children. But kynges and princes, whiche ſay that theſe thynges pertayne not vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do in the meane tyme let, geue, and ſell Biſhoprikes, Abbacies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thinke good, neither thinke they that to be none of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:

                     <hi>Mizpa</hi> was a place moſte apte to haue aſſemblyes in, it was not farre frome <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> In the fyrſte booke of the <hi>Machabites</hi> the thyrde Chapiter,
<pb facs="tcp:18396:273"/> it is thus written: When the people by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyranny of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> fled out of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they aſſembled together in <hi>Mizpa</hi> vnto <hi>Iudas Machabeus.</hi> And it is added that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place was a houſe of prayer of au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient tyme, &amp; laye ſituate ouer agaynſt the City of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And in this booke we haue before heard, how that when <hi>Iiphtah</hi> ſhould be ordeyned Iudge ouer the people, the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in <hi>Mizpa.</hi> In <hi>Samuels</hi> tyme alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people aſſembled together twiſe vnto that place: once when they ſhould leade an army agaynſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> &amp; an other tyme when <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be created kyng. Farther, when all the Citye was ouerthrowen by <hi>Nebuchad-Nezar,</hi> all the people fled to <hi>Godolia</hi> in <hi>Mizpa.</hi> Moreouer beſides the oportunity of the place, was added a notable benefite of God: bycauſe, as we rede in the .10. chapter of <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> there aſſembled thether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a very great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of kynges, for there were not fiue or ſixe, but very many kinges which were neyghbours, entending vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye the name of the Iewes. Yet God commaunded them to be of a good &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt courage, bycauſe he would geue vnto his people the victory ouer them all. And when that thyng happened, contrary to all mans hope, the Hebrues for a monument of ſo great a benefite, built in that place an alter vnto God. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is probable (as the <hi>Rabbines</hi> affirme) that in <hi>Mizpa</hi> began to bee a houſe of prayer. For the people went not to the tabernacle or to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo often as they had occaſion to pray,<note place="margin">Euery Citye had Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> but had in Cityes and Villages certayne Synagoges, wherein they prayed together vnto GOD. But to doo Sacrifices it was not after that manner lawfull but onely at the tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> after <hi>Salomon</hi> had builte the Temple: althoughe hyghe places were ſometymes vſed. Wherfore the people aſſembled thether as well for the opportunity of the place, as alſo by reaſon of the auncient Religion: neither thought they it lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to begyn any thyng without prayers. Whiche inſtitution, for that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes woulde ſomewhat reſemble, they firſte prouide to haue a Maſſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, ſonge before they make any leagues, or rather conſpiracyes agaynſte Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>It is ſayde <hi>that they aſſembled together vnto the Lorde,</hi> to praye together vnto the Lorde.<note place="margin">D.

And to confirme that ſentence, he bringeth a place put of the Pſalme: GOD ſtoode in the Synagoge of Goddes. For Iudges whiche in thys place are called Goddes, when they geue iudgement, ought not to thinke that they haue theyr owne cauſe in hande, but Goddes cauſe, as <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> the godly kynge ſhewed them. I doo not diſſallowe this ſentence: for it is both godly, and alſo it maketh menne to vnderſtande, that when aſſemblyes are godly had, then doo menne aſſemble vnto GOD: whiche thyng if menne in theſe dayes woulde conſider, greate menne woulde handle publique cauſes with more feare of GOD. Howbeit thys is for certayne that the Iſraelites aſſembled not in <hi>Silo,</hi> as ſome thinke.</p>

                     <hi>And the corners of all the people aſſembled.</hi> The Hebrewe woorde is <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth,</hi> whiche properly ſignifyeth corners: but in this place it is taken for Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, heades ouer ten, Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turious, Tribunes, and gouernors of warlike affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

                  <p>They al euen to one determined, that ſo great a villany ſhould be auenged, if the <hi>Beniamites</hi> would not puniſh the guilty, as it was meete they ſhould. The ſumme is: They wil not ſuffer the wicked act to eſcape vnpuniſhed. But howe theſe thinges mought be rightly and orderly done and ordered, was firſt to bee conſidered. For there was a great number of men, namelye .4. hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Wherfore out of that number they chuſed ſome to bring vittayles: &amp; other ſome to aſſayle the enemies. But before all thinges, they ſent a meſſage vnto the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> that if they woulde deliuer the wicked men, they woulde ceaſe
<pb facs="tcp:18396:274"/> from warre. But ſome man wil ſay, was it ſufficient to deliberate to fight, and onely to heare the accuſacion of the Leuite? Vndoubtedlye it ſeemeth that hee ought to haue proued that fact,<note place="margin">What wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Leuite mought haue.</note> both by reaſons, and alſo by witneſſes. But it is probable, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had his ſeruant to witnes, which was preſent when thoſe things were done, and peraduenture that old man, to whom he had turned in. For it is to be thought that he was departed from the <hi>Gabaonites,</hi> for as much as he could not abide their wickednes. But howſoeuer the matter was, the people before they go to hand ſtrokes, decreed to ſend meſſengers vnto the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> that by them they might excuſe their fact, and defende them ſelues. And by that meanes the other part, namely the guilty, was heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the meane time they chuſe thoſe by lots which ſhoulde be appointed to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne offices.</hi> This was the peoples doing: and therfore it was done by choyſe, that they might know, who ſhould cary vitailes vnto the campe, &amp; who ſhoulde fight.<note place="margin">To caſt lots ar moſt apt for the popular ſtate.</note> And to caſt lot ſeemeth to be the moſt meeteſt way for the ſtate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for the people loueth equality of lawes, and equability, which ſeemeth then to be chiefeſt, when choiſe is permitted vnto lots. Wherfore wher as the people gouern, Magiſtrates are oftentimes choſen by lots. So is it alſo in hoſtes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoldiours wil, they doo many thinges betwene themſelues by lots. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the maner therof, that the tenth man of the whole people ſhoulde bee had, ſo that one of ten ſhould by lot be taken, ten of a hundreth, one hundreth of a thouſand, and a thouſand alſo of ten thouſand. This ſeemeth to be a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and commodious way. For now oftentimes in hoſtes a man ſhal ſe more raſcals and vitlers, then ſoldiours. But by this meanes or decree, one tended vp on nine ſoldiours, and ten vpon ninetye. And their charge was to prouide vyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, bicauſe they knew not how long that expedicion ſhoulde endure. So in <hi>Titus Liuius Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Titus Liuius.</note> being created Dictator in a perilous time of the publik wealth, and hauing a iorney to make by night, ſtraightway co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the youth ſhould gather together ſtakes and make readye weapons: but the old men and ſuch as were not apt for warre, ſhoulde dreſſe vittailes for the reſt, as much as ſhould ſerue them for fyue daies. Here we ſee that the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator had his choiſe of them al. But among the Iſraelits ther was no Dictator: wherfore the matter was put to lots. In the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> alſo in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, it is written that <hi>Ioſua</hi> commaunded the tribunes to gather an armye, and that al of them ſhould haue meate ready dreſt to their handes, when they ſhould paſſe ouer <hi>Iordane.</hi> For they wer ignorant what ſhould happen vnto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As it were one man.</hi> They were agreed together, and alſo of one mynde: and nothing is more profitable proſperouſly to make warre, then the concorde of ſoldiours.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Warre whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſeemeth theft.</note>
                     <hi>The tribes of Iſrael ſent meſſengers.</hi> The Iſraelites do appoint nothing raſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly or headlong. This reaſon was moſt iuſt, that before they made any inuaſion by warre, they ſhould proclaime warre. For where that is not done, it may ſeme to bee rather theft, then warre. Farther, they woulde that if anye had beene innocent amonge them, they ſhoulde not haue wrapped them ſelues together with thoſe wicked men. <hi>Delyuer vnto vs</hi> (ſay they) <hi>thoſe which haue committed ſo great wickednes.</hi> That al the people may puniſh them, if ye will not. And they bring foorth the law of God: <hi>That euil may be taken away from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> By euil is vnderſtand ſinne and wickednes: that ſemeth to be taken away, when it is puniſhed.<note place="margin">How euyl is ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken away.</note> But if it remayne vnpuniſhed, then remaineth that God wil take vengeaunce therof. Other do thus expound it: That we maye take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way euil, that is, that we may turne away from Iſrael the calamities, whyche for that ſinne ſeemed to hang ouer it. So Ieſus in the Goſpel healed al diſeaſes and griefes in the people: when as yet he came not for diſeaſes ſake, but for ſins. But diſeaſes are inflicted bicauſe of ſynnes. Therfore ſeing he tooke awaye the cauſe, namely ſynne, he tooke away alſo the effectes of ſynne. <hi>They ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>

Whereby alſo it came to paſſe that they truſted to much in their own ſtrength, and thought that they were able to reſiſt al Iſraell. Wherfore they would neither deliuer the guiltye, nor yet pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them. For they thought it ignominious vnto them, if they ſhould haue don either of them. They would not geue place to ſound counſels, wherefore they could not deny, but that warre was iuſtlye made againſt them, which by honeſt meanes they might haue auoided. But the reſt of the people are to bee prayſed, bicauſe they with ſo great moderacion tooke in hande ſo great a matter.

They tooke out the choyce of their ſoldiours, wherein were not comprehended the inhabiters of <hi>Gibea,</hi> which were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſixe hundreth men of warre, and men picked out. And it is added for a thyng wonderful, that there were of the <hi>Beniamites</hi> ſeuen hundreth, which had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in their right handes, but vſed ſlynges, &amp; leuened ſo nye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they miſſed not euen an heare bredth.<note place="margin">What hande is ſaid to be cloſed</note> It is ſaide <hi>that they had their handes cloſed,</hi> bycauſe the ſinews wer bound, neither could the ſpirites haue their mouings frely.

                  <p>In the Hebrue it is read that the <hi>Beniamites</hi> had .xxvi. thouſande ſoldiours.

Wherfore if a man compare the firſt number with the latter, there are a thouſand ouer, whom other thinke that when their hoſt was diſcomfited, and thinges paſt all hope, they turned backe &amp; fled into <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">D.

For it is not credible that they ſo ouercame, that they loſt none of their ſoldiours. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore if thou adde them vnto the .xxv. thouſand, which fel in the third battail, then is the whole number of .xxvi. thouſande explete. Theſe thinges I knowe are of ſmal waight: which yet I thought good to note, bicauſe the <hi>Rabbines</hi> haue writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten many thinges of them, and the tranſlacions do differ.</p>
                  <p>When the ſoldiours were choſen out, and al thinges ſet in an order, the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſend to <hi>Bethel, and aſke counſel of God.</hi> The Arke of the Lorde was at that time in <hi>Siloh,</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18396:275"/> ſynne, as <hi>R. Leui ben Gerſon</hi> affirmeth. Wherefore God being offended, ſuffred them twiſe to fal before their enemies, and that wonderfullye.

As though God ſhould in this maner haue delt with them: Ye will auenge the iniury done vnto a man, being a Leuite, but ye neglect and wyncke at the contumely which I ſuffer at the <hi>Danites</hi> handes, who publikely worſhip Idoles. Either of theſe ſentences is very likelye, althoughe neither of them is gathered out of the text. Howbeit this we may affirme, that there were ſome certain cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherby God was excedinglye prouoked of the Iſraelites. But what thoſe cauſes were, though we know not, it is no meruayle. For the counſels of God are hidden and obſcure. Order at the length required this, that the Iſraelites ſhould firſt auenge the contumely of God himſelf, and afterward of the Leuite. But this is ſufficiently declared in the text,<note place="margin">What thynges the Iſraelites had omitted,</note> that they at thoſe twoo firſt tymes came not vnto God earneſtly inough. They came in deede: but they neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, nor killed ſacrifices, nor made any praiers, as far as the holy hiſtory decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

Theſe thinges for that they had not, it is probable that therfore they receaued ſo great loſſe at the firſt and ſecond conflict. This thing alſo might bee a cauſe, for that they made warre to much ſecurely and contemptuouſly, as they which dyd put their confidence in the number and ſtrength of their own men. Wherefore they contemned the enemy,<note place="margin">The contempt of enemies hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth very much</note> then the which nothing is more vnprofitable to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal fight.

We ought to attempt nothing, whereof we are not before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whither it be iuſt or vniuſt. For the true knowledge wherof, we muſt ſeke for the anſwer of God out of the holy ſcriptures. The Iſraelites wold not wrap the innocents with the gilty, &amp; therfore they ſent meſſengers at the beginning, which thing at this day is not obſerued in making of wars. Our Capitains and Emperors do althinges without reſpect, &amp; do no les rage againſt children, olde men, maydens, and widowes, then againſt thoſe which haue chieflye offended. The <hi>Beniamites</hi> are worthely to be condemned, bicauſe they defended an vniuſt cauſe, &amp; thought that it would be ignominious vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they ſhould deliuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theirs to be puniſhed, which thing we ſee happeneth very often tymes in theſe dayes. For maiſters defend their ſeruantes, they care not by what right or wrong. For if their ſeruant, although he be gilty, be caſt into priſon, they think that therby co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a great ignominy vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, their famely, and to their court. But they ought to haue iuſtice before their eyes, &amp; not to haue a regard to any thing els, then that the lawes ſhould be kept. The <hi>Beniamites</hi> did put their confidence in their own ſtrength, &amp; the Iſraelites in their great number, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the iuſtnes of their cauſe. But both of them ſinned, for confidence is not to be put either in the ſtrength of ſoldiours, or in the number, or in the iuſtneſſe of the cauſe, but onely in the mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>Although the cauſe be good, yet doth not the thing alwaies ſucceede proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. The <hi>Beniamites</hi> in a moſt wicked cauſe got the victory the fyrſt time, the ſecond tyme, yea and the thirde tyme, yet at the laſt they ſuffered puniſhment, and were ouerthrowen and ſlayne. For God, howſoeuer he do for a time winke
<pb facs="tcp:18396:277"/> at the wicked actes of men, yet he ſuffereth them not alwayes to eſcape vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For the vngodly, as the holy prophetes admoniſhe vs, flooriſhe for a ſhort time: but if thou a litle while paſſe by and returne, he ſhall be no where. That the Iſraelites wer ſo often ouercome,<note place="margin">Why god wold haue the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ouercome.</note> it was the worke &amp; counſel of God, not bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe he would help the wicked men, but to allure his to true &amp; iuſt repentace.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo hereby learne, that in all matters that wee take in hande, three thinges are chiefly to be required: firſt that the cauſe be iuſt which we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.<note place="margin">Three thinges required in eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye thing that we take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> Farther, that we put not the abilitye of performing the ſame in our owne ſtrength, but in God: laſtly, that we put to our endeuor &amp; diligence. Otherwyſe to deſpiſe the meanes, wherby we may attain to our purpoſe, is nothing els the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt God. It is not inough to ſay: I haue a good cauſe, I will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſidue vnto god. We muſt alſo ſtretch out our ſtrengthes, &amp; ad to our diligence: Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore we may not put our affiance in any cauſe, although it be neuer ſo iuſt.</p>
                  <p>Some man wil ſay: what difference then is there betwene a iuſt cauſe, and an vniuſt?<note place="margin">There is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene, to haue a good cauſe, &amp; to haue an euil.</note> Much vndoubtedly. For in an vniuſt cauſe thou canſt not cal vpon God, or truſt that he wil be an helper vnto thee. For an vniuſt cauſe is vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curſe of God, and to cal vpon God to helpe, it is euen like as if I ſhould deſire help of a man, to fight againſt my ſelfe. But if the cauſe be good, euery man maye put his confidence in God, &amp; cal vpon him, but yet not in ſuch maner to put hope in the equity of the cauſe, but that thou mayeſt hope, that God for his mercies ſake wyll bee an ayde vnto thee.<note place="margin">The ſucceſſe maketh not the cauſe eyther good or euyll.</note> If the ſucceſſe bee euill, the cauſe is not therefore ſtraightwaye good. <hi>Nebuchad-Nezar</hi> deſtroyed Iewrye, and ledde awaye the nacions that were adioyning captiues into <hi>Babilon,</hi> and yet was not his cauſe therefore good. Gods cauſe in deede was iuſte: for hee woulde by that meanes take vengeaunce of a rebellious people. But <hi>Nebuchad-Nezar</hi> thought nothing els but to exerciſe his tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny. <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> bicauſe he would auoide adoultery, was caſt into priſon, and yet was not his cauſe therefore euer a whyt the woorſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> was eiected of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and yet was not <hi>Abſolons</hi> cauſe therefore anye whyt the better. In our time Princes that are Proteſtantes haue had yl ſucces in war, and yet is therfore not the cauſe of the Goſpel to be thought the worſe. The <hi>Beniamites</hi> now got the victorye more then once or twiſe, in a cauſe moſte wicked. The holy Martirs in our times are moſt miſerably ſlayne of Tyrannes, and that with moſt cruel kinde of torments, and yet we nothing doubt but that their cauſe is moſt excellent. England had of late, as touching the word of God and truth, a Church moſt rightly inſtituted, which was afterwarde miſerablye diſiected and ſeperated: neither followed it therby that the cauſe of religion was euil. But now thankes be geuen vnto God which hath reſtored it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">From the cauſe to the effects is a firme argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wher the effect followeth of neceſſitye the cauſe.</note>There may in deede be drawen an argument of the euentes, but not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, yea ſcarſe probable. For the paſſage from the effectes to the cauſe, is not firme, vnleſſe the effectes and cauſes be neceſſary.

Moreouer thoſe workes whereby wee ſhould merite, ought to be of our ſelues: which cannot be affirmed, for as muche as it is god which worketh in vs both to wil &amp; to perform, &amp; that not as we wil, but according to his good wil.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> Wherfore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was accuſtomed very wel to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God which crowneth his giftes in vs. And in his .100.

                  <p>There ought alſo to be ſome anallogy or proporcion betwene merites and rewardes, whereof there is none betwene our workes and eternall lyfe.

Some in deede are wont to bring the .xvi. chap. of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> and there they ſay it is written: All mercy ſhal make place vnto euery one, according to the merites of his workes. But they which obiect this thing, let him looke vpon the Greeke text, wherin it is thus written: <gap reason="foreign">

I wyll not ſpeake howe that booke is not in the Canon: bycauſe <hi>Paule</hi> and the Goſpels vſe the ſame forme of ſpeaking. But of that whyche is wrytten vnto the Hebrewes, by ſuche Sacrifices God is well pleaſed, I haue before ſpoken: nowe wyth one woorde onely will I briefly touche the thing. This woorde of deſeruing is not founde in the Greeke. In Greeke is read <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <note place="margin">Of the woorde reward.</note>But as touching this woorde rewarde, which ſome, bicauſe they do not well vnderſtand it, do take for merite, we muſt deuide it two maner of wayes. For that is ſometymes called a rewarde, whiche is geuen freelye, but yet is promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by adding of ſome worke, wherby men ſhould be ſtyrred vp to doo well. So eternal life may be called a reward, not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we deſerue the ſame by our woorkes, but bicauſe by a certain order appointed of God, it followeth our good workes. But ſomtimes a reward is that which is due vnto good dedes,<note place="margin">Whither eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lyfe may be called a reward</note> &amp; is rendred vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them of duty. After this maner eternal life cannot be called the reward of our workes. Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſaith: <hi>Abraham</hi> beleued God, &amp; it was imputed vnto him for righteouſnes. But vnto him which woorketh reward, is not imputed according to grace, but according to debt. Wherefore eternal lyfe, for as muche as it is not of ryght dewe, cannot be a reward, if the woorde be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that ſignification. But when they thus reaſon: there is a reward geuen,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:18396:278"/> 
                     <hi>ergo</hi> there is a merite. The argument is not firme,<note place="margin">A genere ad ſpecies.</note> bicauſe in affirming we may not diſcend from the general woorde to the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> Neyther doth he rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude whych ſayth: It is a liuing creature, <hi>ergo</hi> it is a man. This generall word reward hath two <hi>ſpecies:</hi> therfore this argument is not firme, if we ſaye: It is a reward, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is plaine that it muſt be geuen of dewty.</p>
                  <p>This ſaying alſo of <hi>Ieremy</hi> is to be added: Curſed be euery one that putteth his hope in man, and calleth fleſh his ſtrength. But all our thinges, whatſoeuer they be, are not without fleſh. Wherfore it is not lawful for vs to put confidence in them.<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> And <hi>Ierome</hi> writing vpon that place hath very well brought in manye thinges, whereby may be vnderſtanded that in our workes there is no regard of merite. Yea and the Papiſts alſo themſelues, which ar the patrones of merites, are ſometimes compelled to confeſſe that our merites are nothing at all. For on the 2. Sonday in the Adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thus they pray: Be pacefied O god with the prayers of our humility, and wher helpe of merites do want, ſuccor vs with the aydes of of thy mercy. The fathers, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theyr writings they oftentimes inculcate this word of meriting, do by it ſignify nothinge els, then to get, to obteine, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to. And as manye of them as haue written purelye, the ſame haue deteſted the conſideration of merites, whereof the papiſtes ſo much boſt. Wherfore the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raelites were not heard thoroughe the merite of their teares or prayers, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by fayth in Chriſt to come they obteyned forgeuenes of ſins, and ſo by his merite onely they returned into fauor againe with god.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They offred ſacrifice.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What profite the ſacrifices of the law had.</note> Although I haue before largely ſpoken of the ſacrifices in the olde time, yet I thinke it good here alſo briefly to touch what profite was of them in the old law. When men are vexed with calamityes, they beginne to think vpon theyr ſin, they loke vpon the law: wher whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they behold the wrath of god kindled for ſinne, they are in hart deiected: in which perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no remedy, but to get them vnto Chriſt, which is the ſumme and end of all ſacrifices. Him did the fathers, which wer godly, embraſe by faith: but in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices, as often as the ſacrifice was ſlaine, ſo often the death of Chriſte was after a ſorte ſet before the eyes of thoſe that ſtoode by, by whoſe death the ſynnes of the world ſhould be taken away.<note place="margin">The ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the olders &amp; ours at al one, but differ in outward Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles &amp; ſignes.</note> Wherfore they had after this manner a communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on amonge themſelues in Chriſt, which by ſundry notes and ſignes dayly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the people in the old time, wherhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they by fayth receaued vnto their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion both his death and the fruite therof as we do. Wherfore <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth trulye vnto the <hi>Corrinthians:</hi> All did eate of one, and the ſelf ſame ſpirituall meate, and all dronke of one, and the ſelfe ſame ſpirituall drinke. And they dronke of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rituall rocke following them. And that rocke was Chriſt. Wherefore the elders had theyr miſteries and ſacraments, whereby they alſo embraſed Chriſt. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly as touching the thing, they had the ſame that we haue, the difference was onely in the Simboles.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Auguſtine</hi> noteth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certaine other differences,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Differences be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of the elders and ours.</note> which here to rehearſe ſhal not be vnprofitable. Firſte they hadde manye ſacramentes, and wee but few: the Simboles of our ſacraments are water, bread, and wine: they had oxen calues, ſhepe, gotes, doues, turtle doues, bread, wine, oyle &amp; ſuch other like. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the condicion of our ſacramentes is diuerſe from the equality of theirs: for theyrs were more greuous, but oures are by Chriſte made both eaſier and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lighter. Moreouer thoſe ſimboles that were geuen vnto them, were conteined in one country onely, but ours ar common to the whole world. Farther in them Chriſt was ſetforth, as he which ſhould come: but to vs, as he which is now alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye come. But as touchinge ſaluation there is no difference. For the ſame ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and the ſame Chriſt was offred vnto them, which is ſettefoorth vnto vs.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:279"/> This is alſo to be added, that our Sacraments are more manifeſt and excellent, for aſmuch as they haue more manyfeſt woordes of Chriſt and his redemption, which make fayth more ful. And therfore the ſprite is now had more abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then it was in that time, if we ſpeake of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſtate of men. For I ſpeake not of perſons ſingularely, neither do I thinke that <hi>Abraham</hi> had leſſe faith and ſprite then chriſtian men now haue. But now let vs returne vnto the hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The hebrewes when they were afflicted, fled vnto God by Chriſt, who was ſet before them in their ſacrifices, and was there apprehended by fayth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence was all the vtility of their ſacrifices, to the offring or receiuinge wherof it was not lawfull to come raſhly, otherwiſe they ſhould haue beene to their hurt, and ſhould haue kindled the wrath of God againſt them, which thinge <hi>Paul</hi> hath very well admoniſhed vs of ſaying: He whiche eateth or drinketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh vnto himſelf damnation.<note place="margin">What the puri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fications of the Elders ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> Wherefore in the law there were many purifications, ſprinkelings, and waſhinges, before they came vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeruices.

Yea and in <hi>Deut.</hi> the .13. chapter: God commaunded, that if any citye of the Iſraelites fell vnto idolatry, all the tribes ſhoulde go vp and ioyne theyr po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers together and conquer it, ſo that they ſhoulde with ſword and fire deſtroye all thinges that they found in it. But the <hi>Beniamites</hi> defended a manifeſt wicked act, which differred not much from idolatry, and it is poſſible that the city of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah</hi> was idolatrous. Wherfore nothing ought to be reſerued in it. In the boke of <hi>Ioſuah</hi> it is written, that when <hi>Acham</hi> had hidden for himſelf a certayn ſmall thing of the curſe of <hi>Iericho,</hi> the whole hoſt was afflicted for that cauſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate being afterward found out, not onely he himſelfe was killed, but alſo hys ſonnes and daughters, with his oxen, his aſſes, his ſhepe, and his tente alſo and all his ſtuffe. Which thing yet we muſt not thinke that it was done by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript of the law, but by a certaine ſingulare counſell of God.<note place="margin">Ciuill warres more cruel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward wars</note> But whither Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell exceded meaſure in this auengement or no, wee ſhal afterward ſee.

                  <p>But before I define what faſting is, I think it good firſt to vſe a diſtinction.<note place="margin">A diſtinction of faſtes. Natural faſt</note> For foraſmuche as there are ſundry kindes of faſtings, they ſerue not all to our purpoſe. For there is a certaine faſt that is naturall, whyche pertayneth eyther to the recouering or to the defending of the health of the body. Wherfore <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18396:280"/> ſayth, that they which are of a full and perfect age, or alſo are old, can verye well abide to faſt: in which place old men are to be vnderſtande as touching the firſt part and beginning of age.

There is an other faſt which is ciuil, &amp; is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taken in hand, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are ſo bent to their things, that by no meanes they will intermitte the affaires which they haue begonne. So <hi>Saule</hi> when he purſued the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> and had the victorye nowe in his handes, commaunded that no man ſhould taſte of any meat before euening. So alſo certain Hebrewes vowed that they would neither eate any thinge or drinke,<note place="margin">A faſt familiar vnto chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> before they had killed <hi>Saul,</hi> as it is written in the actes of the Apoſtles. This manner alſo of faſting pertaineth not to this preſent matter. There is an other kinde of faſting, which ought to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar vnto all Chriſtans, namely to take meate ſoberly and temperatly: which thing they ſhal do, if they neither eate to often in one day, nor whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do eate, doo gorge themſelues with to muche meate, or ſeeke for delicates and fine ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſobriety.</note>This manner of liuing is very muche profitable to diminiſhe luſtes, neyther ſuffreth it the minde to bee troubled with affections. It maketh the minde more chearfull and redy both to prayers, and alſo to the actions of the life. Wherfore Chriſt ſayd: let not your hartes be oppreſſed with ſurfeting or dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Be ye ſober, for your enemy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil goeth about like a roaring lion, ſeking whom he may deuour. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo wrote of himſelfe: I chaſten my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and bring it into bondage, leaſt I preaching to other, ſhould be made a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Farther there is an other commodity of this faſt, that thereby expenſes are ſpared, not to lay them vp couetouſly, but that that which is ouerplus vnto vs, we may geue vnto the poore.</p>
                  <p>There is an other faſt which is aboue mans ſtrength, and is ſometimes geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god meruelouſly vnto ſome of the ſaints,<note place="margin">Miraculous faſte.</note> to commend theyr doctrin. <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mountayn faſted .40. dayes, for God would by a notable example ſhew, that that law which he ſetforth, came from himſelf, and was not inuented of men. Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther went <hi>Moſes</hi> therfore vnto the mountayne to faſt, but to receiue the lawe of GOD, and to talk with him. <hi>Elias</hi> alſo receued bread and water of the Aungel, and in the ſtrength of that meate walked .40. daies, euen vnto the mount of god <hi>Horeb,</hi> that hee by this miracle ſhoulde bee declared to bee the true reuenger of the lawe. By this kynde of faſtynge our Sauioure commended the preachynge of the Goſpell, that it ſhould not ſeeme to bee a thynge vulgare, but ſhoulde be proued a thyng begonne by God. But theſe wer miracles, neyther pertayne they anye thinge vnto vs, but onelye that wee ſhoulde haue them in admiraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by ſuche examples bee ſtirred vppe with reuerence to receaue the word of God.</p>

As when we beinge deſtitute of meate, haue not wherof to eat. Here is nede of pacience, and we muſt pray vnto god, that he would ſtrengthen and encourage vs. So the ſaints when they wandred about, and preached the Goſpel, wer compelled ſomtimes to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

This kind of faſting men do not take vpon them of their own free wil, but it is layd vpon them by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Religious faſt.</note>But omitting all thoſe, as which nothing pertayne vnto our diſputation, let
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18396:280"/> vs come to our faſt which we may cal religious. And this faſt is an abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> not onely from meate and drinke, but alſo from all other thynges whiche may delite and nooriſhe the body, contrary to the accuſtomed manner, as much as ſtrength will ſuffer, and it is done of a repentant mynd and of a true fayth, by prayers to deſire the clemency of God, for miſeryes, eyther already oppreſſing vs, or very nighe at hand. The forme of this definition is abſtinence,<note place="margin">An expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the cauſes of true faſting.</note> and that aboue the accuſtomed manner, whiche yet excedeth not ſtrengthes of the body. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not onely meate and drinke, but alſo all thynges whiche may reioyſe the body. The efficient cauſe is fayth and repentance for ſinnes committed agaynſt God. The end is, by prayers to craue the mercy of God, and to turne away or to diminiſhe calamityes. Therfore they whiche faſt,<note place="margin">Exerciſes of thoſe that faſte truely.</note> ought to geue themſelues to prayers, almes, viſitynges of the ſicke, and to the holy ſupper.</p>
                  <p>When we feruently pray vnto the Lord, and do from the heart truly repent vs of the ſinnes which we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, &amp; for their cauſes are earneſtly afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we can not eaſely thinke vpon meate, drinke, &amp; fine delicates. For who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a griefe grieuouſly vrgeth, it is more pleaſant to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abſteyne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is any other delectation. So <hi>Dauid</hi> in his .35. Pſalme ſayth of his enemyes: When they were ſicke, I laughed not, but put on ſacke clothe, and afflicted my ſoule with faſting, and earneſtly prayed for them. They whiche deiect and humble themſelues (by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they in a manner diſpaire of their things) are wont to contemne and loth meate and drinke, and other delightes and pleaſures. Hereby we may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">Why faſtyngs pleaſe God. <hi>Ierome.</hi>
                     </note> how it commeth to paſſe, that our faſtes doo pleaſe God, not aſſuredly that the emptines of the belly pleaſeth God.

This plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, that we deiect the mynde, that we returne vnto him with prayers, and caſting away other pleaſures, do put all our delectation in him onely.</p>
                  <p>But the faſtes wherof we now intreate,<note place="margin">Faſtes publike and priuate.</note> are ſometymes publique and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes priuate. Priuate faſtes we take in hand, when we are afflicted with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and domeſticall miſeries: for there is none whiche is not vexed ſometymes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in himſelfe, or in his famely. Or if it happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that peraduenture he be not gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with any calamity of his owne or any of hys:<note place="margin">We muſt faſte ſometymes for other mennes ſakes.</note> yet ſometymes he muſt mourne for other. For if we be the members of one &amp; the ſelf ſame body, we muſt thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes of our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pertayn vnto vs our ſelues. So <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed for them which afterward became his enemies, &amp; which reioyſed in his euils. So <hi>Iobs</hi> frindes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw hym vexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt grieuous plagues, lay ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dayes full, in duſt and aſhes, before they ſpake any thyng vnto him: ſo much wer thoſe men moued with his miſery. Wherfore before they commoned with hym, they would by faſting and prayers deſire God to aſſwage his ſo great miſery. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid</hi> when <hi>Abner</hi> was ſlayne, did not onely mourne at his buriall, but alſo ſware that he would y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day taſte of no meate before the ſunne were ſet. The ſame thing did he when he was reproued of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophete, and when he had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued tydinges of the death of the childe. Vndoubtedlye all the whole tyme that he was ſicke, he neuer toke meate. <hi>Nehemias</hi> in the .1. chap. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of the Hebrewes whiche remayned in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> afflicted himſelfe with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and prayed vnto the Lord. <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo when he had red thoſe things which <hi>Ieremy</hi> wrote of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captiuity of .70. yeares, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed both his owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the people, wept alſo and faſted. Wherfore priuate faſting ought to be taken in hand, not onely for our ſelues, but alſo for others.</p>
                  <p>But publique faſting is two maner of wayes commaunded:<note place="margin">How publique faſtes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> Either of God himſelf by the law, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magiſtrate, or of the Biſhop, or els of a Prophet.

For fellowſhyp with the wife nothyng letteth, but that they may be vſed priuately, but whether he vnderſtood publique faſtes or priuate, it ſkilleth not much.</p>
                  <p>Farther, Chriſt being aſked of his Apoſtles, why they could not heale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and caſt out the deuil. He anſwered: Bycauſe of your incredulity. And he added: This kynd of deuils is caſt out onely by faſting and prayer. That place is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darke, and therfore it ſhall not be vnprofitable briefly to expounde it. Is it to be thought, that by the merite of faſtyng and prayers (as they vſe to ſpeake) deuils are caſt out by vertue of the worke wrought? Not ſo. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſignified the woordes of Chriſt? Firſt he ſaid: Bycauſe of your incredulity: for if ye had fayth, euen ſo muche as a grayne of muſtard, and ſhould ſay vnto this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne: Take vp thy ſelf, &amp; caſt thy ſelf into the ſea, it ſhould obey you. And toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a fayth, is neceſſary a vehement and feruent prayer, and alſo faſtyng, bycauſe a fixed and earneſt prayer which draweth the mind, not onely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meate and drinke, but alſo from all other humane cogitacions and pleaſures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt by the effectes deſcribeth the cauſe, namely, fayth by prayers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and he ſpeaketh of thoſe deuils, to whom god gaue more liberty, as though he ſhould haue ſayd: ye muſt not lyue eaſely or idely, if ye will caſt out this kynd of deuils. Ye muſt haue a ſure and ſtrong fayth whiche thyng he expreſſed by the effectes, by prayers I ſay and faſtes.</p>
                  <p>By theſe reaſons and teſtimonyes may faſtes alſo be commended in the new Teſtament. But in them are faultes to be taken heede of,<note place="margin">What vices in faſting ar to be taken heede of.</note> whiche very often are many, and thoſe greuous.

                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> bringeth a reaſon why the Wenſday is to be faſted, namely by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was that day taken vp to heauen: for it is written, that when the bridgrome is taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then they ſhall faſt, and this he affirmeth to be the tradition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, when as yet at this day we beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the Thurſday:<note place="margin">We muſt geue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For there are many of them, whiche euen they themſelues can not deny, but that they are ridiculous and vayne. I know in deede there are traditions founde whiche are neceſſaryly gathered out of the holy ſcriptures, and for that cauſe they ought not to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. But other traditions whiche are indifferent, are not to be augmented in number, leaſt the Churche ſhould be oppreſſed, neither to be thought ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they can not be aboliſhed. And we muſt beware that in them be not put the worſhipping of GOD. But as for thoſe whiche are agaynſt the woorde of god, are by no meanes to be admitted. In the diſt. 76. chapter .1. are added <hi>Imber</hi> dayes, or the Faſtes foure tymes in the yeare. Which why they are ſo diuided, ſcarſely can any man perceaue. They cite <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon <hi>Zachary,</hi> who maketh mention of the fourth moneth, fift, ſeuenth, and tenth. And they ſeeme to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a wicked zeale to diſtribute theſe faſtes into foure partes of the yeare.

Here by the way we muſt declare which was the ninth houre. The vi. houre was at none, in which tyme we rede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt our ſauiour was crucified.

The elders dyd ſo deuide the tyme,<note place="margin">The diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res among the elders.</note> that alwayes from the Sunne ſet to the Sunne ryſing they counted 12. houres, and agayne as many from the ryſing of the Sunne to the goynge downe thereof. Agayne they deuided eyther tyme into foure ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe they called watches: And euery one of thoſe ſpaces contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned three houres. Wherefore the thirde houre from the ryſing of the Sunne is with vs eyther the eyght or nynth houre, as the tyme of the yeare requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: For theſe houres are vnequall. The ſixte houre is noone, and the nynth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18396:283"/> is the thirde at after noone, and the .xii. at the ſunne ſet. But <hi>Thomas</hi> obiecteth vnto hymſelfe, that whiche we ſay, namely, that the elders faſted the whole day. It is ridiculous to heare what he aunſwereth. Bycauſe we (ſayth he) are in the ſtate of the day, and the elders were in the ſtate of the nyght: therefore we muſt finiſhe our faſtes in the day tyme, when as they ended them in the night tyme. And he bryngeth this ſaying of <hi>Paul:</hi> The nyght is paſt, &amp; the day hath drawen nyghe. Whiche ſentence how much it ſerueth to this preſent thyng, all menne ſee and vnderſtande.</p>

But they ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> reproueth thoſe onely, whiche auoyded ſome meates, as euill creatures, and beleued that thoſe euill creatures came from an euill God: but we (ſay they) do teache no ſuch thyng: we onely forbid me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome kind of meate for one day, or a few dayes, which afterward we ſet at liberty.<note place="margin">Montanus an heretike. <hi>Tertulian.</hi> What choiſe of meate is to bee followed.</note> As though <hi>Montanus</hi> could not after this manner haue excuſed himſelf, againſt whom theſe places are cited of the fathers. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lian</hi> accuſeth <hi>Marcio</hi> as an heretike, bicauſe he did put ſome holines in fiſh.

                  <p>There is an other abuſe bycauſe they impoſe ſuch faſtes which the ſtrengthes of men are not able and abyde. For they will haue the people faſt .40. dayes. Which thyng, if it ſhould be required accordyng to the preſcript rule of GOD, and of the olde Churche, namely that the faſt ſhould be continued vntill euen, no man in a manner were able to performe that. And that inſtitution ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre vnto <hi>Theleſphorus</hi> the Pope, other ſome to a tyme a litle before hym. And vndoubtedly therein is nothyng elles, then a certayne mere wicked zeale and noughty imitation of Chriſt. For he faſted .40. dayes: therfore ſuperſtitious then thought it good that Chriſtians ſhould faſt ſo many dayes euery yeare, when as yet Chriſt faſted after this maner,<note place="margin">Chriſte requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not of hys Apoſtles the faſt of Lent.</note> but once in his lyfe tyme: neither required he at any time any ſuch acte of his Apoſtles.

They ought to haue regarded that Chriſt all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme did eate nothyng, &amp; in that he could ſo long endure, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to haue pretayned to a miracle, and to the power of God: The holy ſcriptures no where commaunde,<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> that in that thyng we ſhould imitate Chriſte. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in hys .47.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18396:284"/> reaſon I promiſe you. Why doth thys <hi>Gregory</hi> forget that the Leuiticall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode and ceremonies thereof haue now ceaſed? Wherfore it is not lawfull to bind chriſtian men to tenthes and Iewiſhe ceremonies.

Why did not the Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proue them, bicauſe they deceaued god of ſuch a kind of tenth?</p>
                  <p>But why Lent was inuented, as much as I can gather I wil declare.<note place="margin">Why the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inſtituted Lent.</note> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when they ſaw men liue very careleſly and negligently, thoughte it good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled after a ſort to renew godlines in ſome part of the year, &amp; ſomewhat to bridle the fearcenes of the fleſh. And for this thing they thought that the .40. dayes before Eaſter were moſt mete, that men ſhould ſo long haue theyr minds both occupied in repentance, &amp; alſo in remembring the benefites of God. This inuention, although at the firſt ſight it might ſeme trimme,<note place="margin">The inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lent is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberty.</note> yet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not with Chriſtian liberty. For we muſt think vpon the benefites of god and of our greate ingratitude, and other our moſte grieuous ſinnes, not onelye 40. daies, but alſo continually. Farther by this meanes they opened a moſt wide window to liue ſecurely and reacheleſlye. For if they once had performed fullye thoſe .40. dayes, they thoughte that all the whole yeare after they mighte geue themſelues wholy to al kind of pleaſures and luſtes. For they referred the time of repentance to theſe .40. dayes. And although the elders had a lent,<note place="margin">Euſebius.

What (ſayd he) can we not liue at concord, although they vſe theyr owne rites as we vſe ours? For ſome faſt in the Lente two dayes, ſome .4. dayes, ſome ten dayes, ſome .15. ſome .20, and other ſome .40. dayes, and yet is concord neuertheles kept in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Ther is an other abuſe,<note place="margin">Faſting is an excerciſe &amp; not a holines.</note> namely bicauſe ſom put holines in faſting as though a worſhipping of god conſiſted in it, where as in very dede faſting is onely an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerciſe, which of it ſelfe hath no holines.

                  <p>And vndoubtedly herein the elders oftentymes erre,<note place="margin">A fall of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> for that they prayſe &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol faſting aboue meaſure. If ſo much ſhould be attributed vnto faſting, we muſt of neceſſity confeſſe that <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt liued more holily then Chriſt. For he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted more then Chriſt did. For Chriſt did eate and drinke as temperate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt men vſe to do: But it is ſayde that <hi>Iohn</hi> did neither eat nor drinke.

                  <p>The Iſraelites, as farre as may be gathered by this hiſtory, had bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with a double othe. Firſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man ſhould geue his doughter to wyfe to the <hi>Beniamites:</hi> which was nothing els, but that they were minded vtterlye to deſtroy the tribe of <hi>Beniamin.</hi> Farther, they ſware that if any of the Iſraelites had not put to his help agaynſt the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> he ſhould be ſlain. Here are very many things worthy to be noted. Firſt, we muſt conſider that the Iſralites wer to ſeuere againſt the <hi>Beniamits.</hi> For they did not onely ſlay the men, but alſo the wiues and maydens: wherefore there were no women left on liue for thoſe .600 menne whiche were remaininge, to engender yſſue of. But afterwarde when the ſame Iſraelites more diligentlye conſidered their acte, they iudged it not wel done, that a whole tribe ſhould be cleane deſtroyed.

<pb facs="tcp:18396:286"/> and commaundement of God, whych appeareth not to haue beene doone in this hiſtorye. In reuenginge we muſte keepe a meane: for all are not to be ſlaine which come into the power of them that ouercome. It is ſufficient to puniſh the guilty.<note place="margin">God puniſheth moderatly.</note> God ſlew in Egipt <hi>Pharao,</hi> alſo the firſte begotten, and many other, yet deſtroyed he not the whole nation.

                        <p>The othe of the Iſraelites being vniuſt, did not bind them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it.</p>
                        <p>It was not lawfull for daughters to marry without the conſent of theyr parents.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Farther we muſt note that this othe of the Iſraelites of not geuinge wiues vnto the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> was neyther godly nor lawefull. Wherefore they were not bound to obſerue it. Howbeit we vnderſtand by this hiſtory, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was of force among the people of god, that the daughters ſhould not mary without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of theyr parentes. For if it had bene lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue maried againſt theyr parentes will, a man might haue ſaide: Althoughe ye will not geue your daughters vnto them, they of their owne accord may contract matrimony with them. This thing is ſo agreable vnto nature, that the Romaine lawes alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that matrimony ſhould be firme, except it be contracted by the conſent of the parents, as we haue before declared. But that thing which neither God, nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor good lawes can ſuffer, the ſame doth the Papiſticall ſuperſtition eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitte.</p>
                  <p>The Iſraelites come to <hi>Siloh</hi> for two cauſes, partly to aſke counſell of God concerning the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> and partly to geue thanks vnto God for the victory. Therfore they burne ſacrifices and burnt offringes. And they wept for the miſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> euen vntil euen. Wherfore it appeareth that they faſted the whole day, otherwiſe they could not haue wept before the lord vntill euen.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Why the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites erected an altare. <hi>Dauid Kimhi</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>And they erected an alter.</hi> But to what ende? There was an altare there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Some aunſwere that there was an altare there indeede, but it was ſo old, that it was halfe decayed, and therfore it neded to be repayred. But <hi>Kimhi</hi> ſaith that it was a cuſtome, that when all the people ſhoulde publikely aſke counſell of God, there ſhould of new an altare be erected. But this he affirmeth without the authority of the word of God. I rather thinke, when ſo great a multitude of people aſſembled together, ther was ſo great a number of ſacrifices, that the old altare was not ſufficient to do holy ſeruices vpon. Wherfore that the ſeruice of of god ſhould be with more expedition finiſhed, there was erected an other altar. Which thinge alſo we rede <hi>Salomon</hi> did, when he dedicated the temple whiche he had built.</p>
                  <p>When they had wept, bicauſe of the othe wherby they had bound themſelues not to mary theyr daughters vnto the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> they thought vpon the other othe, whereby they had vowed themſelues to ſlay all thoſe whiche woulde not
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18396:286"/> put to their helpe to the common warre. Neither is their any mencion made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this latter othe. For many thinges are ouerpaſſed in the hiſtorye, which are afterwarde ſpoken of, althoughe not in their place. And whileſt they are in hand with theſe thinges, with one and the ſelfe ſame labour they both prepare wiues for the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> and alſo ſaued their othe. For they which wer abſent from the warre, were not bounde by the othe. Wherfore they might mary their daughters vnto the <hi>Beniamites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as touching the firſt othe for not geuing wiues to the tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> it was not lawful. Wherfore it might haue bene broken without any violating of religion: for the cutting of of that tribe, was againſt the word of god. For his wil was that it ſhould be preſerued among the people of Iſrael. For God by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cob</hi> the Patriarche gaue manye and excellent bleſſynges vnto the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> which bleſſinges alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> repeated.

For he found a meanes that they ſhould ſerue in the tabernacle, and ſo by that meanes bee after a ſorte puniſhed wyth cyuill death. Although he durſt not do that, but by the commaundement of god. And he would that the people by his example, ſhould learn not eaſely to violate an oth.<note place="margin">For example ſake euen vain othes ar not ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſely to be viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                  </p>
                  <p>Althoughe I thinke that in this matter alſo the Iſralites wer to cruel. For it

Neither could they ſay that they had vowed vnto the Lord the vow <hi>Cherem,</hi> foraſmuch as they had ſaued the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den virgins.

                     <hi>Haue compaſsion on vs for them.</hi> The ſenſe of this ſhort and briefe prayer is this: We wil ſay that we wer ſorowful and penſiue, and that we could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way ſeeke and prouide wiues for the <hi>Beniamites.</hi> And whatſoeuer is done, we wil affirme to haue bene done by our counſel, and that we were the authors therof.

Other do eaſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expound it: Gratefy vs, and geue vs your maidens, if you thinke them vnwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy to haue them. We thought that there had bene maidens inough of the <hi>Iabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites:</hi> but that happened otherwiſe. Wherefore we were conſtrained to prouide for them by ſome other meanes. And if they wil ſay that they are bounde by an othe, and that they cannot geue them: vnto that we wil anſwer, that their othe is ſatiſfied, bicauſe they themſelues haue not geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their daughters, but ye haue ſtollen them. Here we perceaue that a publike othe is lenefied and mitigated by the interpretacion of the Elders. And vndoubtedlye that is their office whyche gouerne a publike wealth. <hi>Ye</hi> (ſay they) <hi>haue not geuen them of your owne free wyl,</hi> wherfore ye are free from the othe. Therefore the <hi>Beniamites</hi> are prouided for by rapte or ſtelth.<note place="margin">The rapt of the Sabines.</note> In the <hi>Romane</hi> hiſtorye alſo it is ſaide that the virgines of <hi>Sabine</hi> were rapte or ſtollen, but yet ſomewhat after an other ſorte.

                  <p>In that theſe men interprete and lenefy the othe, it hath ſome ſhewe of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For it might ſeeme that the fathers violated not their othe, bicauſe they of their own accorde gaue not their daughters vnto the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> but they tooke them away by violence.

And on the other ſyde it ſeemeth that the Iſraelites gaue their daughters of their owne accord, &amp; fraudulently brake their oth. For the fathers ſware y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they woulde not geue their daughters to the <hi>Beniamites.</hi> Howe had they them then? Of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

The Iſraelites pretended the religion of an othe: which yet they craftelye violated, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented to rapte or ſtealth, which wicked act is no more remiſſe then periurye. They wyll not geue an example of periury, and they graunt to rapte. Farther they violate an other principal pointe of the law of God. For in the laſt chap. of

                     <hi>Numbers</hi> it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, that if a mayden be an inheritour, ſhe ſhould not mary into an other tribe, to the ende that inheritances ſhould not be confounded. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſome of theſe that were ſtollen, were inheritours? Vndoubtedlye they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of God maryed out of their tribe.</p>
                  <p>If a man wyll ſay, they did thys wyth a good minde, and (as they vſe to ſaye) for a godly intent, that the whole tribe of Beniamin ſhould not vtterlye periſhe: Anſwer may be made, it is not ſufficient that a thing be done with a good minde: bicauſe alſo we muſt ſee that the thyng whych is done, be good, be iuſt, be right, and agreable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woord of God. Farther, God forbyddeth that matrimonies ſhoulde be ratefied wythout the conſent of the Parentes. But here the maydens are rapte, and maryed not onely wythout the knowledge of the Parentes, but alſo agaynſte their wyls, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt good lawes, and authority of the woord of God. Farther, the Magiſtrate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to pacefy the Parentes, and to reconcile them vnto them, if they chaunce to be angry: and ſo they fall from one wycked act into an other, neither aſked they counſel of God in thys thyng. They take counſel of themſelues, as though in a thyng of ſuch perplexity and obicureneſſe they coulde not erre. And that we ſhoulde not maruayle that theſe thyngs ſo happened, this verſe is agayn repeated: <hi>There was no king in Iſrael.</hi>

For the rapter may either haue a wyl to haue her for his Concubine, or to abuſe her for his pleaſure, although he take her not to wyfe.

Wherefore that crime extendeth farther then that definicion containeth. Onely harlots ſeeme to be exempted. For they are not ſaid properly to be rapted, although they be led away by violence. And vndoutedly it is then no action of rapt, but onely of iniuries.

And the reaſon is added, bicauſe if the rapter woulde abſtayne from the rapte, it is not very likely that any woman wil offer her ſelfe of her owne accorde to be rapted. Wherfore it ſemeth probable, that ſhe was won by flattery &amp; deceites. Yea, &amp; the Parents of the maiden, if they conſent to the rapte, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be baniſhed. Theſe things <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> decreeth in the Code, who yet afterward in the Authentikes (where is entreated of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rapted, which mary the rapters) was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law new, bicauſe ther wer which canelled, that if ſhe that was rapted did conſent vnto matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhe might poſſes the goods of the rapter. For ſo they interpreted the firſt law: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the goods of the rapter ought to come vnto her that was rapted, if ſhe maried him, or if he in his wil made her his heire: But we (ſaith <hi>Iuſtinian</hi>) ment no ſuch thing: for our lawes do not appoint rewardes for a wicked crime. Farther, neither can he make any wil, for aſmuch as he is now condemned to dye, neither do our lawes ſuffer any ſuch matrimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny to be of force. And if it be no matrimony, how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe poſſes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods of the rapter in the name of a dowry? wherfore he decreed that ſuch matrimonies ſhould not be rate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied. What then ſhal become of the goods of the rapter? If the maiden (ſaith he) haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, which haue not therunto conſented, thoſe goods ſhall come vnto them. But if they haue conſented as it is alredy ſaid, they were baniſhed without anye propritye of goods or landes, which kinde of puniſhment was much more grieuous then playn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile. But if the mayden had no Parentes, or had thoſe which conſented, the goods of the rapter were confiſcate to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſory. By theſe thinges appeareth that in thoſe tymes rapte was counted a deteſtable crime.</p>
                  <p>Wherunto this thing alſo I wil adde, if any daughter had maried againſt the wyll of her parents, or otherwiſe behaued her ſelf wantonly &amp; vnchaſtly, it was lawfull for the parents to diſinherite her, as it is had in the Code, <hi>De Inofficioſo Teſtamento,</hi> in the law <hi>ſi fileam.</hi> This one thing is excepted. If the father knew that the iuſt time of matrimony was paſt, &amp; he would not place his daughter, then hath he nothing to ſaye againſt hys doughter, if ſhe mary without his knowledge, or againſt his wil: yea rather he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to geue her a dowry, as it is had in the Code in the ſame place, in the law <hi>Si poſt viginti quinque annos.</hi> Wherby it appeareth that <hi>.25.</hi> yeares was the time of fartheſt prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gacion of matrimonye. The ſame thing is had in the Digeſtes, <hi>De ritu nuptiarum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rapt a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Now is to be added the opinion of the Canoniſts,<note place="margin">The opinion of the Canoniſts</note> &amp; what they bring out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures. In the <hi>.36.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi> Gracian bringeth that definicion of rapte, whiche we haue before confuted. But this thing he addeth: That in rapte is iniury done ſomtimes to the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; not to the parants: &amp; ſomtimes to the parents, &amp; not to the mayden: &amp; ſomtimes to both of them. For if the maiden wil be rapt of her own free will, there is no iniurye done vnto her, but vnto her parents. But if the parents geue the man power to rapte the daughter, bicauſe ſhe wil not conſent to mary him, then is no iniury done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but vnto the daughter. But to both of them is iniury done, when the mayden is led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her parents, againſt her wil, &amp; aginſt their wil,<note place="margin">Conſilium An reliauenſe.</note> &amp; in the ſame place he bryng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the counſel of Orleance, in the chap. <hi>de raptoribus,</hi> where alſo he confeſſeth that rapte was wont to be puniſhed with death. But it is added, that if the rapter come vnto the Church, the puniſhment of death is eſcaped. What ſhal there then be done? If the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (ſayth he) conſented vnto the rapter, firſt ſhe ſhall be taken from him, &amp; be reſtored to her parents, but yet being excuſed, that is, a caution receaued, that ſhe be not ſlayne or diſinherited. But if ſhe conſented not, ſhe is by her ſelfe ſufficientlye purged: but the rapter ſhal be compelled to publike penaunce, as it is had in the <hi>.36.</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>Raptores.</hi> But what if he wil not do penance? He ſhalbe exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilium Chal cedonenſe &amp; Cabilonenſe.</note> according to the counſel of Chalcedonia &amp; Cabilonum. But if he do penance, he ſhall be puniſhed by the purſſe. And herein they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they follow the word of God, which is written in Deut. <hi>22.</hi> chap. If a man defile a mayden, he ſhal geue vnto her parents <hi>.50.</hi> ſycles, and ſhal take her to wife. And ſo he condemneth the rapter to pay a certain ſum of mony vnto the parent of the mayden. The which ſum if he wil not pay, or haue not wherwithal to pay, he is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſerue the father of the maiden for certaine yeres, which the Gloſer contracteth to fyue, vpon this condicion, that in the meane time he may redeme himſelfe if he wyll.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo added: If they conſent together, the matrimony is firme, ſo that the father agree therunto. And that theſe matrimonies may be firm betwene the rapter &amp; her that is rapted, it alſo appereth by the decretals <hi>de Raptoribus et incendiariis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conciliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mel denſe.</note> in the chap. <hi>cum cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> &amp; in the chap. following. Which thing without dout is againſt the ciuill lawes, &amp; the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are of the better ſort. But the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of Meldenu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath far otherwiſe decreed.
<pb facs="tcp:18396:290"/> For firſt it hath ordained, that the rapter, &amp; ſhe that is rapted ſhould do publike pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: afterward it permitteth matrimony, but yet not betwene themſelues, but wyth other. And it is added, that if the huſband or wife of either of them die, he which hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the rapte, or conſented vnto the Rapter, cannot contract new matrimony, except the bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop releaſe him. Farther it is ordained, that by no meanes any ſuch matrimony ſhuld be firme, no though the Parentes conſent therunto. Yea, and the ſame Gracian confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,<note place="margin">Conſilium A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſgrauenſe.</note> that the ſame thing was decreed in the Counſel which was had at <hi>Aquiſgranum.</hi> Yet afterward, both he himſelfe otherwiſe defineth, &amp; alſo the decretals of the Popes. What then make they of thoſe Counſels? They anſwer, that thoſe Counſels ment this, that it ſhould not be lawful to contract matrimony in that caſe, vnles open penance be fyrſte done, and the conſent of the Parentes had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ierome.</note>And to proue that ſentence. Gracian (in the .36. q. 2. chap. <hi>Tria</hi>) citeth Ierome, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to acknowledge three lawful kindes of matrimony. One, when a mayden is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in matrimony to a huſband by her Parentes or Tutors. An other, if a mayden bee oppreſſed of a man, &amp; her father afterward conſent to geue her him in matrimony. The third is, if the father co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent not to ſuch mariages, but geue her vnto an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe three matrimonies he ſaith are lawful in the holy ſcriptures. But in the .27. q. 2. chap. <hi>Additur,</hi> is by the teſtimonye of Ierome an other kynde of lawfull matrimonye added, namely when a widow, which is not vnder the power of the Parentes, marieth in the Lord. Hereby Gracian gathereth that Ierome acknowledgeth matrimonye betwene the Rapter &amp; her that is rapted. But I perceaue that in the .22. chap. of Exodus, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intreated of rapte, onelye mencion is made of fornication, and not of rapte. For it is ſaid: If he ſhal by flatteries allure her to lye with him, then hath he libertye geuen him, that he may take her to his wife, hauing the conſent of the Parentes. But if a man had rapted a mayden or man chylde, then he was iudged by the lawe called <hi>Lex Plagii,</hi> which is written in Deutronomy, &amp; teſtifieth that he ſhoulde be puniſhed with death, whoſoeuer ſtealeth a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Iſrael. Wherfore ther is nothing writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſcripture (as far as I ſe) as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtabliſhing &amp; racefieng of ſuch a matrimony</p>
                  <p>But here ſome man wil obiect, that Iacob &amp; his ſonnes conſented, that Sechem one of the ſonnes of Demor,<note place="margin">Of the rapte of Dina.</note> ſhould haue in matrimony Dina Iacobs daughter, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem had rapted, ſo that his ſubiectes would ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be circumciſed. I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this: but it was done before the law of Moſes was geuen. Neither do we rede that the Patriarches had anye woorde of God concerning this thing. Neither can it be denyed that before the law was publiſhed, very many thinges wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt it. Iacob, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we now intreate, had the ſame time .2. ſiſters in matrimony. Amra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had to wyſe his Aunt, of whom he had Moſes, Aaron, &amp; Maria, which matrimonies, after the law was geuen, wer not lawful. Wherfore the example now brought, proueth nothing.</p>
                  <p>But if hope of matrimony ſhould be geuen vnto Rapeters, there ſhoulde be opened a wide window for furious yong men to vſe raptes. For they wyll make no doubt to rapte, if they may hope to mary her whom they haue rapted. But all occaſions of euyll are to be taken out of the publike wealth and the Church. Farther, foraſmuche as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes are highly to be honored, if matrimonies ſhould againſt their wils he contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwene the Rapter and her that is rapted, they ſhould ſuffer great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumely. This thing alſo ſemeth to be added, that Lucius the Pope writeth to the biſhop of Burgenu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it is had <hi>Extra de Raproribus et Incendiariis,</hi> in the chap. <hi>Cum cauſa</hi>) that he decreeth, that if a mayden ſaye, that before ſhe was rapted, there were woordes paſſed betwene them of mariage, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be called properly rapte. What ſhal then be done? May ſhe agaynſt her Parents wil mary the Rapter? Innocentius the .3. in the chap. following, decreeth: If a maiden be rapted againſt her wil, and afterward conſent to mary the Rapter, that mariage is alſo firme, yea although it be agaynſt the wil of her Parentes. And he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that this is done in the honor of matrimony, when as in deede it apertlye pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the reproche therof, if a man do more deepely weigh the whole matter. In the 27. q. 2. chap. <hi>Raptor,</hi> it is had: If a mayden that is rapted, bee betrothed vnto an other, by the woords of the future tence, ſhe muſt be reſtored vnto him, ſo that he wil receaue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>her. But if he wil not, it is free for the maiden which was rapted to mary an other. But if ſhe were betrothed by the woords of the preſent tence, and that ſhe can proue that ſhe was rapted againſt her wil, the ſpouſe if he wil not receaue her, ought to be compelled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens opinion. <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nas.</hi>
                     </note>The ſchole Deuines write not much diſagreing vnto this. Thomas Aquinas in .2. 2. toucheth this queſtion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he writeth that capte ſpringeth of a vehement luſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Rapter is ſo troubled, that he neglecteth al daungers. And he wyll haue her that is rapted, to be rendred vnto her Spouſe, if ſhe haue any: and if ſhe haue none, vnto her Parentes, or if ſhe be wythout Parentes, to them in whoſe power ſhee was. And then if they wil agree, ſhe may mary the Rapter: but ſo, that firſt be made reſtitucion, bicauſe in al theft and rapte reſtitucion is chiefly required: yet ſaith he, rapte before reſtitucion be made, letteth matrimonye to bee contracted, that is, that they ſynne, if they contract matrimony: but if it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted, it breaketh not the contract. But to the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18396:290"/> determine againſt it, be anſwereth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were made in deteſtacion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crime. But the Pope afterwarde conſidered the matter better. But this was not the parte of a holye man to woorſhip the Pope for God, and ſo to flatter him lyke a bondſclaue. And to the ende he might ſeeme to ſpeake rightlye, he bryngeth the woordes of <hi>Ierome,</hi> which are in <hi>Gracian</hi> concerning the three kindes of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye. But how that place ſerueth to this preſent matter, I haue before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Laſtlye, hee obiecteth vnto himſelfe the Counſell of <hi>Meldenum.</hi> But that place he ſayth, is to be vnderſtand: If a man ſhall rapte her which was maryed vnto an other. As thoughe that were obſcure or doubtfull. Wee neede no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to vnderſtand this. A certaine Deuine not of the woorſte ſorte, ſtronglye ſetteth himſelfe againſt Thomas concerning thys thing, and where Thomas ſaith, that rapte letteth not the matrimony already contracted, he aunſwereth, that many decrees make againſt that ſentence. Farther hee bringeth a reaſon, namely that he which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate can not receiue the ſacramentes. And then he addeth that the Rapter is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated: wherfore vnles he do open pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and reconcile hymſelfe vnto the Church, he cannot contract matrimony.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Caietanus</hi> there laboureth vtterly to defende hys Thomas,<note place="margin">Caitanus.</note> and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he which is excommunicate, cannot receaue the Sacramentes. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it this he confeſſeth, that he which is excommunicate, ſynneth if hee receaue the Sacramentes. And he addeth: If an excommunicate be admitted to confyrmaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or to holy orders, it cannot be denyed but that hee hath receaued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, neither is it lawful for him to repeate them againe, if he afterward doo penaunce. Farthermore, he ſayth that the Mayſter of the Sentenſes in the .iiii. where he reckoneth the impedimentes, whych take awaye matrimonye contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, numbreth not rapte at all. Farther, he teacheth that the Rapter, and ſhee that is rapted, are not by the act it ſelf exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, but to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated. But bicauſe he ſeeth it is in the Canons of the counſel of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> &amp; <hi>Cabilon:</hi> Let the Rapter and her that is rapted be accurſed, he anſwereth that the Gloſe enterpreteth that ſaying to be of the ſame force, as if it had bene ſayd: Let them be accurſed. Moreouer he anſwereth to the other twoo thynges concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitucion and penaunce, &amp; he ſayth, that ſhe that is rapted, ought not to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but it is ſufficient, if he ſatiſfy the father by ſome meanes, although ſhe bee not rendred vnto him into his hand: euen as in theft it is not alwayes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that thinges taken away ſhoulde be reſtored, but ſometymes it is ſufficient, that the iniury be recompenced by a price or bonde. But concerning penaunce he ſayth: The Rapter, if he contract without it, doth ſynne in dede, but yet after he hath contracted, the matrimonye is firme. Laſtlye, he ſaith that the Canons, which decree to the contrary, are either abrogated, or els doo ſpeake of ſpouſes. After this maner Thomas, <hi>Caietanus,</hi> the Deuines, Eccleſiaſtical men, &amp; Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes triflle among them ſelues, &amp; play the Paraſites with the Pope their God.</p>
                  <p>Now wil I declare, what the holy ſcriptures determine of rapte,<note place="margin">The ſentence of the holye ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and what they iudge thereof. The firſt place is out of the booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the .6. chapter, where it is wrytten: The ſonnes of God ſeing the daughters of men that they were fayre, tooke them to wiues, ſuch as they luſted them ſelues. I know there are brought ſundry interpretacions of this place. Some expounde the ſonnes of God to be angels, which being kindled by the beuty of faire women, had fellow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip with them. This expoſicion cannot agree: for foraſmuch as angels haue no bodies, they cannot burne in ſuch luſtes. Others by the ſonnes of God vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe which came of <hi>Seth,</hi> and were brought vp in the true worſhipping of God, who being ouercome with beuty &amp; fayrnes, contracted matrimonies with the daughters of <hi>Cain,</hi> that is, with Idolatrers and Infidels. Whereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nowe remayned ſounde and perfecte, and therefore God ſending a flood,<note place="margin">The Chaldey interpreter.</note> deſtroyed the whole worlde. The Chaldey Interpretour ſayth, that the Sonnes of God were myghtye men, and Magiſtrates, who when they hadde taken to wyues the daughters of vyle men, all thynges were fylled wyth vyces.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18396:291"/>
                  <p>Here I ſee was committed rapt, which thing the Chaldey Paraphraſt hath ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, which paraphraſt among the Hebrues is of an incredible authority. And aſſuredlye <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith not that they deſired thoſe wiues of their Parentes, but onely tooke them whom they lyked beſt. By that place may eaſely be noted the courſe, and as it were the degree of mans peruerſnes. For firſt they ſawe, and then they deſiced, and at the laſt they rapted. Neither were they wonne by their vertues, but onely by the beauty of the body. Wherfore God puniſhed that ſinne by a flood. And although there were many other ſynnes in men, yet this one is expreſſed with a great emphaſis.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer in the <hi>.34.</hi> chap. of the ſame booke, <hi>Sechem</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hemor</hi> dyd rapte <hi>Dina</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iacob.</hi> But what ende that rapte had, it is not nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful now to declare.<note place="margin">Curioſity was the cauſe that Dina was rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> But the cauſe why <hi>Dina</hi> was rapted, was her curioſitye: the mayden would go foorth, and vnderſtand the maners of other women. Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did then hurt her, &amp; alſo wil alwayes hurt women. For if it were hurtful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the famely of <hi>Iacob,</hi> being ſo great a Patriarche, for a mayden to wander a broade, howe muche more daungerous is it for other famelies, which are not ſo holy nor acceptable vnto god? But the nature of women is much infected with this vyce. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> admoniſheth women to loue their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, to bring vp their children, and to be byders at home. And to <hi>Timothe,</hi> when he entreateth of wanton and yong widowes: they wander abroade (ſayth be) and runne from houſe to houſe, and at the laſt go after Sathan. Yea, &amp; theſe virgins, of whom we nowe entreate, when they wandred thorough the vyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes, and gaue themſelues idely vnto dauncinges, were taken vp by the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamites.</hi> Some man wil ſay, that the brethren of <hi>Dina</hi> oppreſſed the <hi>Hemorhites</hi> by guile. It is true in deede, but when they were reproued of their Father, they ſayde: Ought they to haue done <hi>Niblah,</hi> that is, a fooliſhe and wycked thing in Iſrael? And that <hi>Dina</hi> was rapte not wyllingly, but againſt her wyl, hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, bycauſe it is written that <hi>Sichem,</hi> after he had oppreſſed her, ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her hart, which ſignifieth nothing els, then that he woulde by flatterye haue comforted her.</p>

For it is not my mynde to bring in a confuſion of thinges. But theſe two things I affirme, firſt that in contracting there is ſinne, eſpecially if it be done againſt the wil of the Parentes. Farther, that thoſe lawes, wherby ſuche matrimonies are permitted, are to be corrected, that hereafter it be not lawful to doo the like. For we ſee that the order whyche God hath ſet, is peruerted, when Parentes are neglected, by whoſe counſels ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trimonies ſhould be contracted. And by this meanes yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at encouraged to raptes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may mary the wiues who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhal rapte.

Wherfore let the Canoniſtes &amp; Schoolemen take hede how they iudge the contrary. Now reſteth ſomwhat to ſpeake of daunces.</p>

                     </gap>, I omitte to ſpeake of the filthy kynde of daunſinge, bycauſe it is apertly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the lawes.

                     </gap>, how fat it is lawful,<note place="margin">Daunſing by it ſelfe and of his owne nature is not vicious.</note> foraſmuch as it is excerciſed for mirth ſake. Aſſuredly I thinke that this kinde of daunſing is not of his owne nature vicious or prohibited, bicauſe nimblenes and agility of the body is the gift of God, and if there be added any arte, namely that the body be moued in order, aptly in nomber, and with come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, I do not ſe why it ought to be reproued, ſo that it be doone in time, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and without offence. For euen as it is lawfull to ſing, and we may vſe ſinging to geue thankes vnto god, and to celebrate his prayſes, ſo alſo by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate daunſing we may teſtify the ioy and mitth of the minde. For <hi>Dauid</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely daunſed before the arke of the Lord, &amp; the maidens with daunſes &amp; ſonges celebrated his victory againſt <hi>Goliah.

                     <hi>Pharao</hi> was ouerthrowen &amp; ſlayne, led daunſes with other women, and ſoong a ſong of victory. Wherfore ſeing holy men and chaſt women haue vſed daunſes, we can not ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of theyr own nature they are vicious.<note place="margin">Daunſinges vſed at thys day ar vicious.</note> But as it is vſed in theſe dayes that men ſhould daunſe mingled together with wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ought not to be ſuffred, bycauſe theſe thinges are noriſhmentes and prouokers of wantonnes and luſts. <hi>Maria</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Moſes</hi> daunſed not with younge men, but apart by her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women. Neither daunſed <hi>Dauid</hi> with women, and maidens which cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated his victory daunſed among themſelues, and not with men.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer they which loue God withall their heart, &amp; withall their ſtengthes, ought not onely to obſerue his commaundementes, but alſo to cut of all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whereby the obſeruing of them might be letted.</p>
